Alternatively, an institution may choose to consistently use a one-year constant position assumption.” We infer from the context that the institution’s choice according to sentence 2 (“a one-year constant position assumption”) is just one way of operationalising an “assumption of a constant level of risk”. The other way of operationalising this assumption is to assume re-balancing at the end of the liquidity horizon as stated in sentence 1.

In the case at hand, this holds especially true for repurchase transactions and securities lending or borrowing transactions which fulfil the criteria in Article 227 as specified in Article 222(4) CRR. However, this reduction of risk weights is overruled by Article 429b(4) CRR, as the derogation is subject to a 20% floor, and thus does not apply in this respect.     As a consequence the risk weight of 20% has to be applied with regard to the collateralised portion of the total exposure (Article 222(3) CRR).     In addition, in the case of those portions of exposure values that are not collateralised by the market value of eligible collateral institutions shall apply the risk weight that they would assign to an unsecured exposure to the counterparty (Article 222(3) CRR), and in accordance with Article 429b(4) this is also subject to a 20% floor.     Accordingly, regarding the numerical example in the question section of this Q\u0026A, supposing that the security value is 1025 and the collateral value is 1000, this would result in two components in terms of Article 429b(4) CRR: An exposure value for the unsecured part and an exposure value for the secured part, which both have to be summed up. The former would be 25 multiplied by the risk weight that would be applicable to an unsecured exposure to the counterparty under Chapter 2 of the CRR, but at least 20% (e.g. 25 * 20% = 5). The latter would be 1000 multiplied by the risk weight that would be applicable under Chapter 2 of the CRR where the lending institution had a direct exposure to the collateral instrument, but – again – at least 20% (e.g. 1000 * 20% = 200). Thus, the add-on for counterparty credit risk calculated in accordance with Article 429b(4) CRR would be at least 205 (200 + 5).","Article":"429b","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":" In the example below, under Financial Collateral Simple Method would the add-on be the same as under Article 429b(2) CRR, that is 25, or should it be based on (1025 * 0.20) = 205 – 200 (1000 * 0.20), that is 5?"}

We understand that Arrangements to Pay are agreements by which a bank agrees to a postponement of payments due a date after the normal due date of the contract. The modalities of this postponement seek to maximize the ability of the counterparty to service its debt. Following the Arrangement, if the counterparty is allowed to repay the amounts due in one payment only, the Arrangement is called a Promise to Pay. Contracts under Arrangements to Pay may be classified as defaulted or impaired.  For the purpose of Template F 19.00 Paragraph 163 of the EBA Final draft ITS on Supervisory reporting on forbearance and non-performing exposures under article 99(4) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR) defines forbearance measures as \"concessions towards a debtor facing or about to face financial difficulties in meeting its financial commitments\".  According to , paragraph 164 (a)  \"a concession refers to...a modification of the previous terms and conditions of a contract the debtor is considered unable to comply with due to its financial difficulties (\"troubled debt\") to allow for sufficient debt service ability, that would not have been granted had the debtor not been in financial difficulties\". In order for a concession to be identified, the modification of the previous terms and conditions of a contract shall be linked to the financial difficulties of the debtor, and it has for purpose to enable sufficient debt service ability.  Paragraph 165 then provides examples of what a concession includes. These examples are however non-exhaustive. In general, the classification as forborne should consider the substance of the agreement rather than the \"formal\" modification of the terms and conditions (i.e. an agreement by a lender to extend the payment date of a contract beyond the originally contractually agreed due date is a modification, even if the contract is not formally modified).  On the basis of paragraphs 163 and 164, two conditions shall be satisfied in order for an exposure to be classified as forborne: 1) the financial difficulties of the debtor and 2) a modification of the previous terms and conditions of a contract due to the debtor's situation.  In addition, paragraph 172 specifies four situations that have to be treated as forbearance measures as, in these situations, the two above conditions are considered met:  (a) a modified contract was classified as non-performing or would in the absence of modification be classified as non-performing;  (b) the modification made to a contract involves a total or partial cancellation by write-offs of the debt;  (c) the institution approves the use of embedded forbearance clauses for a debtor who is under non-performing status or who would be considered as non-performing without the use of these clauses;  (d) simultaneously with or close in time to the concession of additional debt by the institution, the debtor made payments of principal or interest on another contract with the institution that was non-performing or would in the absence of refinancing be classified as non-performing.  Based on the examples provided by the submitter, our understanding is that Arrangements to Pay or Promises to Pay are extended to borrowers in state of financial difficulties and allow them to postpone the contractually-agreed date of their payments due to a later date in order to maximise their ability to service their debt. We understand that Arrangements or Promises to Pay are an arrear management tools and are extended to borrowers that are in financial difficulties. The two conditions (financial difficulties and concessions) identified in paragraphs 163 and 164 are therefore satisfied and Arrangements to Pay and Promises to Pay qualify forbearance measures.  Especially, in the three cases on which guidance is asked:      An Arrangement to Pay for a counterparty in financial difficulties to ensure the counterparty will not become 90 days past due: this is a concession extended to a borrower in state of financial difficulties as per paragraph 172a. To assess whether the counterparty would become non-performing in the absence of Arrangement or Promise to Pay, the lender should evaluate whether it would lead to the counterparty to be classified as non-performing, i.e. defaulted, impaired, more than 90 days past-due or otherwise \"unlikely to pay\")  An Arrangement to Pay for a counterparty in financial difficulties which postpones payments to after the 90DPD: this is a concession as the borrower is in state of financial difficulties and the payments are postponed beyond their due date to address these difficulties. This situation is covered by paragraph 172a  An Arrangement to Pay for a counterparty already 90DPD: this situation is covered by paragraph 172a   The classification as forborne exposure is unrelated to the classification of this exposure as defaulted, impaired, or non-performing: exposures with forbearance measures can be performing forborne or non-performing forborne, according to the conditions detailed in paragraphs 157, 164 and 172.  DISCLAIMER:  The present Q\u0026A on Supervisory reporting is provisional. It will be reviewed after the respective Implementing Regulation is in force and published in the Official Journal, which may differ from the text of the relevant draft ITS to which  it relates    ","Article":"Context","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":"The question concerns the identification of forbearance measures, namely the ‘Arrangement to Pay’ and the ‘Promise to Pay’. With this question I want to propose that an Arrangement to Pay will not be classified as forbearance. I would like to know whether you agree on my conclusion. Forbearance (EBA definition) Debts with forbearance measures are contracts / the terms (1) of which the debtor is considered unable to comply with (2) due to its financial difficulties so that the institution decides (3) either to modify the terms and conditions of the contract to enable the debtor to service the debt or to refinance, totally or partially, the contract. When determining whether a measure constitutes as forbearance the following aspects should be taken into account: A. Is the counterparty in financial difficulties? B. Is there a modification of the terms and conditions of the contract? C. Is the modification a concession? D. Is the classification of forbearance aligned with the objectives of the regulator? Promise to Pay and Arrangement to Pay For the purpose of the classification of forbearance, I consider the Promise to Pay to be a special case of the Arrangement to Pay. The sole difference is that with a Promise to Pay all payments are done at the same time, while in an Arrangement to Pay the payments can be at multiple times. For the remainder of this memo I will therefore only refer to the Arrangement to Pay. Three possible cases can be distinguished with respect to Arrangement to Pay: 1) An Arrangement to Pay for a counterparty in financial difficulties to ensure the counterparty will not become 90 days past due (90DPD). 2) An Arrangement to Pay for a counterparty in financial difficulties which postpones payments to after the 90DPD. 3) An Arrangement to Pay for a counterparty already 90DPD. An Arrangement to Pay in the situation the counterparty is not in financial difficulties will never be considered to be a forbearance measure. Especially measure 2 and 3 have raised discussions on the classification of forbearance. Analysis A. Is the counterparty in financial difficulties? In all cases the counterparty is in financial difficulties. B. Is there a modification of the terms and conditions of the contract? An Arrangement to Pay is not technically a modification of the terms and conditions of the contract, as these remain intact. However, ESMA states[1] “lack of action by the lender towards the borrower (e.g. lack of enforcement of covenants in the contract) can be considered a form of forbearance”. A strict interpretation might allow one to conclude that an Arrangement to Pay can still constitute forbearance. However, an Arrangement to Pay cannot be considered a “lack of action by the lender”. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria given by EBA and ESMA for a modification. C. Is the modification a concession? In principle, a postponement of payments can be considered a concession even if the total amount of payments is not altered. However, in all cases the objective of an Arrangement to Pay should be to ensure the counterparty pays as much as possible given its repayment capacity. The objective of the measure is therefore not to provide additional leeway to the counterparty. Assuming the objective is indeed to maximize the counterparties’ debt servicing capacity, then the measure should not be considered a concession. Usually banks have a maximum period for a counterparty before it is moved to recovery. This provides a natural cap on the length of the period for the Arrangement to Pay. Only in the case that de bank applies the measure in such a way that it is not aimed at maximizing the counterparties’ debt servicing capacity, the measure might be considered as a concession. To remove any uncertainty about this measure, such a measure should not be referred to as Arrangement to Pay. D. Is the classification of forbearance aligned with the objectives of the regulator? EBA states[2]: · it has concerns relating “… to uncertainty surrounding the extent of the use of forbearance, potentially aiming at, or in practice leading to, delaying loss recognition and masking asset quality deterioration”; and · that it aims to “assess the extent of forbearance transactions and their effects on asset quality and loss recognition.” Whenever a counterparty has any arrears a bank needs to take measures with the counterparty to ensure it pays its obligations. At the very least a bank will make an Arrangement to Pay with the counterparty to pay its obligations as soon as realistically possible. When classifying every Arrangement to Pay to a counterparty with any arrears more than 30DPD as forbearance, this would imply that effectively every contract with 30DPD would constitute forbearance. I do not believe this is in line with the objective of the EBA to improve on transparency on, and reduce uncertainty about, the asset quality. In particular, when the Arrangement to Pay postpones payments to after the 90DPD or is applied to a counterparty already 90DPD, it will be recognised as defaulted and impaired. There is no delay in loss recognition nor does it mask asset quality deterioration. Conclusion The Arrangement to Pay does not meet all the mentioned criteria to constitute forbearance, irrespective of the current number of days past due of the counterparty. It is assumed that an Arrangement to Pay is always applied in such a way that it maximised the counterparties debt servicing capacity. A agreement with a counterparty which does not meet this assumption should not be identified as an Arrangement to Pay, but be classified as another type of measure to reduce uncertainty. http://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/449824/EBA-ITS-2013-03+Final+draft+ITS+on+Forbearance+and+Non-performing+exposures.pdf [1] ESMA/2012/853: Treatment of Forbearance Practices in IFRS Financial Statements of Financial Institutions [2] EBA/ITS/2013/03: EBA FINAL draft Implementing Technical Standards On Supervisory reporting on forbearance and non-performing exposures under article 99(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013"}

For instance, starting from one arbitrary covered bond in circulation, the reporting item would be constructed from the cover pool backing that covered bond and would expand to all other covered bonds backed by that same cover pool. The definitive perimeter of the reporting item has to reflect the perimeter of each applicable covered bond regime (e.g. depending on whether the applicable covered bond regime would avail a preferential claim of covered bond investors to the portion of a mortgage exceeding a loan-to-value necessary for cover pool eligibility or not, the reporting item would have to include such portion or must not include it).  Example 1 - reporting at solo level:  Reporting institution is a German Pfandbrief bank; Pfandbriefe in circulation are for each of the types of mortgage Pfandbriefe (Hypothekenpfandbriefe) and public sector Pfandbriefe (Öffentliche Pfandbriefe) multiple issues of bearer bonds (Inhaberpfandbriefe) - different ISINs - and multiple registered Pfandbriefe (Namenspfandbriefe). Since the German Pfandbrief Act applies its protective measures - especially the ring-fencing mechanism in case of insolvency of the issuer - along the perimeter of types of Pfandbriefe in circulation of an issuer (i.e. liabilities from Pfandbriefe of a given type in circulation including cover pool derivatives registered to that type of Pfandbrief's cover pool, and cover assets registered to that type of Pfandbrief's cover pool), the items to be reported were one public sector Pfandbrief cover pool and one mortgage Pfandbrief cover pool.  Therefore, in the example given of a bank with several issuances of covered bonds backed by only one cover pool, the cover pool should not be broken down proportionally on each covered bond  Example 2 - reporting at consolidated level:  Within the reporting group the only issuers of UCITS-compliant covered bonds are a Danish bank - issuer of SDOs separately covered by real estate mortgage loans in three distinct capital centres - and a German bank - issuer of mortgage Pfandbriefe. For the reporting in relation to the Pfandbriefe, the reporting would be effected mutatis mutandis as in the first example; since the Danish covered bond regime's protective measures apply at the level of each capital centre (e.g. the balance principle), in respect of the Danish subsidiary three separate SDO capital centres were to be reported.

Article 29 of Regulation 241/2014 provides for 3 different options for repurchases (i.e., market making (3), acquisition for employees (4) and other reasons for a predetermined amount (5)).  The “discretionary trading activity over treasury shares” is a wide common activity carried out by listed companies to engage purchases and sales of their own shares on entirely discretionary basis (with no commitment from the listed company to carry out purchases or sales and no expectation from the market that such activity will occur at any given price or for a given volume). This activity is substantially different from the legal definition of market making set forth in Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council, and by the European Commission and in the EU draft legislative proposals for banking reform (see Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on structural measures improving the resilience of EU credit institutions).  Concretely, the “discretionary trading activity over treasury shares” lacks the essential requirements of the market making activity, namely: (i) the existence of a “commitment”; and (ii) to “provide market liquidity on a regular and on-going basis”. It is also different from other practices recognized over treasury shares (i.e. liquidity agreements). Therefore, in our view, any application for supervisory permission for repurchasing CET 1 instruments that may be carried out by a credit entity under its discretionary trading activity over treasury shares shall be subject to Article 29(5) and not to Article 29(3).  On the other hand, Article 28(2) lays down that credit institutions shall deduct the corresponding elements from their own funds to be repurchased before the effective repurchases occur if such “repurchases are expected to take place with sufficient certainty, and once the prior permission of the competent authority has been obtained. [...] Sufficient certainty is deemed to exist in particular when the institution has publicly announced its intention to repurchase an own funds instrument”.   ”Sufficient certainty” requirement set forth by Article 28(2) cannot be met in the case of discretionary trading activity over treasury shares, as no unconditional commitment is assumed for posting firm orders for purchasing ordinary shares, as opposed, for example, to market making activity. On the contrary, credit entities have full discretion to post orders when executing their discretionary trading activity over treasury shares and there are times during which they may not post orders (such as in the period leading to a results announcement).  Additionally, no announcements are or will be made in relation to the intention of any credit entity to execute its discretionary trading activity over treasury shares, as the only public information related to the discretionary trading activity over treasury shares is the on-going reporting to the applicable authorities  on already executed transactions. Consequently, as the discretionary trading activity over treasury shares (i) does not correspond with market making activity; (ii) does not comply with the “sufficient certainty” requirement; and (iii) does not involve any public announcements in relation to the intention to its execution; we understand that deductions shall follow the standard deductions regime established by Article 36 of CRR according to which deductions on CET 1 capital shall occur whenever each specific repurchase order is carried out from time to time by a credit institution under its discretionary trading activity over treasury shares.

However, the aforementioned provisions of the CRR do not specifically refer to market making. Instead, Article 29(3) of the RTS provides for specific provisions relating to market making; those provisions strictly limit the amount of instruments that may be repurchased for market making purposes. Therefore the amounts that can be repurchased are small, and not comparable to the potential outcome of Liability Management Exercises (\"LME\"), where a material part or all of an issuance could be repurchased under certain conditions (see Q\u0026A 2013_290). In addition, the predetermined amount for which permission under Article 29(3) of the RTS has been given must be deducted from own funds on a corresponding deduction basis from the moment the authorisation is granted (see Q\u0026A 2014_1352). The RTS, however, does not specify when market making can take place (i.e. if those provisions apply only after five years after the issuance date). Therefore, it could be concluded that market making can take place at any time after issuance provided that the conditions stipulated by the RTS are met. Under those conditions, it can be argued that repurchases in market making need to be treated specifically due to market making’s distinct goal – to provide liquidity to investors in given instruments with an intention to resell them in the market in the longer term. In that respect there is no obvious reason to apply different rules before and after five years from issuance date. Also, the need for market making is deemed to exist from the issuance on. Furthermore, when repurchasing for market making purposes institutions do not intend to hold the instruments being subject to market making for a long period of time, but instead to resell them into the market. Finally, it can be argued that the principle of proportionality should be taken in to account when applying the CRR and the RTS. Preventing market making activities during the first five years of the issuance date may thus be a dis-proportionate application of the prudential rules.

The form of support referred here is intended to capture wholesale term secured funding (via repo transaction). Term means that the initial maturity or first call date is greater than one year. Example: ECB LTRO.’  According to the definitional reference ECB LTRO as an important source of funding should be reported in the item in row 010 of P 02.02 of Funding plans. But if the validation rule v4135_m, which connects the item in P 02.02, r010 to item P 01.02, r010 (Repurchase agreements), is to be followed, the LTRO should be performed as a repo transaction.  In our opinion, the definition of LTRO as a strictly repo transaction is not accurate in all cases. In Slovenia LTRO is performed using the securities of the banks as collateral. However, the banks do not sell securities to the central bank with an agreement to buy them at a later date. As a collateralization technique the central bank uses a pool of assets. A counterparty includes eligible marketable assets in the pool of assets at the central bank by ensuring the maximum pledge on such assets in favour of the central bank. Individual assets are therefore not linked to specific credit operations. Such credit operations are therefore reported in Finrep as Deposits with agreed maturity. If the validation rule v4135_m would be enforced as a blocking rule, the banks would report LTRO differently in Finrep (as a deposit with agreed maturity) as in Funding plans (as a repurchase agreement).  We would also like to note that the central bank is not necessarily part of the public sector. Therefore the name of the table P 02.02 is not entirely correct, if the items reported include funding like ECB LTRO, which is performed through central banks.

The percentage thresholds referred to in the second indent of Article 94(1)(g)(ii) of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD) - the 50% representation threshold, and the 66% and 75% majority thresholds - should all be calculated by voting rights attached to the shares or other ownership rights in the firm. These are the voting rights capable of being cast on the relevant resolution (see also point (iv)). While the second indent of Article 94(1)(g)(ii) of the CRD refer to shareholders, it is clear that CRD requires the percentages to be counted by reference to the shareholders or owners voting rights and not the number of natural persons who are shareholders or owners. Under the company law in some Member States it may be established that each owner has just one voting right, independent of the percentage of capital he or she holds.  ii. As per point (i) the 75% threshold, which applies when fewer than 50% of shares are represented in the vote and the 66% threshold, which applies when at least 50% of shares are represented, are calculated in relation to the shareholders or owners voting rights that are represented, and not the number of natural persons who are shareholders or owners (which would reflect a firm's whole issued share capital or ownership rights - including specific issuances which may not have any voting rights).  iii. The concept of shares or ownership rights being \"represented\" is not defined by the CRD; it depends on the legal nature of the firm in question and national company law. In general \"represented\" should be understood as being put in a position which would have enabled the shareholder or owner to vote on the proposed higher ratio, independent of how such a vote is taken. In line with this principle and taking into account national company law firms should set their internal policies as to which forms of conduct will constitute being represe nted for the purpose of this vote.  Furthermore, without prejudice to national law, it should be noted that to determine what proportion of the share/ownership rights is \"represented\" as required by CRD, a poll vote should actually take place at the relevant shareholder meeting (even if the outcome of such a vote may appear obvious from a show of hands and/or any proxies received). In line with the applicable company law, firms should make it clear to shareholders/owners how each form of conduct (voting for or against, sending a proxy, abstaining, attending but not voting etc.) will be treated for the purpose of being represented. The meaning of being \"represented\" is the same for the threshold test (i.e. the 50% test) as for the majority test (i.e. the 66% or 75% test).  Voting results should be duly documented and disclosed.  iv. According to the last indent of Article 94(1)(g)(ii) of the CRD, staff who are directly concerned by the higher maximum levels of variable remuneration are not permitted to exercise any voting rights they may have. Accordingly, their voting rights should be disregarded when calculating the percentages, both in the nominator and the denominator. Where national company laws set out higher thresholds than those laid down in the second indent of Article 94(1)(g)(ii) of the CRD, these higher thresholds should apply.","Article":"94","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":"(i) Could the EBA clarify the procedure to be followed for a firm to increase the variable remuneration above the basic limit of 100 % of the fixed remuneration. In particular with regard to: whether the percentages referred to in the second indent of 94(1)(g)(ii) should be counted by reference to share or ownership voting rights or the number of individual shareholders or owners, (ii) whether the 75% threshold, which applies when fewer than 50% of shares are represented in the vote and the 66% threshold, which applies when at least 50% of shares are represented, are percentages of the share or ownership voting rights represented or the firm’s whole issued share capital or ownership rights, (iii) is there a definition of the concept of shares or ownership rights being “represented”?

Is it consistent to make a link between FINREP and the C 67.00 template – section 1 (r010) + 2 (r120) – when: 1- FINREP is based on a different scope from that of liquidity risk (prudential/liquidity), cf. Article 18 of Regulation 575/2013 (CRR). 2- FINREP is done on a quarterly basis while the ALMM templates have a monthly frequency. 3- The deadlines for submitting the ALMM templates are shorter (t+30 calendar days then t+15 calendar days) than those of the FINREP templates (t+30 working days on average, set by the EBA). 4- In this context, how should the weighted average initial and residual maturities of other liabilities be calculated (section 2 – r120)?"}

Hence, only the difference (surplus or deficit) appears on the balance sheet. Article 4 of the CRR defines ‘defined benefit pension fund assets’ as ‘assets of a ... pension fund ... after they have been reduced by the amount of obligations ...’, i.e. it refers to pension fund surpluses. Articles 36 and 41 then deal with these surpluses. Assume, for example, a pension fund is not in a surplus position. Hence, there is no deduction from CET1. The question is whether the gross pension fund assets (equities, bonds ...) would need to be risk-weighted. CRR does not require this explicitly - but the BaFin has given guidance on this in its response to enquiry T002N003F001: Essentially, pension assets need to be risk-weighted - without netting against liabilities and irrespective of whether assets are held under trust.

This definition makes clear that a net amount (i.e. net of defined benefit liabilities) has to be deducted from CET1 items pursuant to Article 36(1)(e) of the CRR.  Pursuant to Article 41(1) of the CRR, the net defined benefit pension fund assets to be deducted from CET1 items shall be reduced by the amount of any associated deferred tax liability which could be extinguished if the assets became impaired or were derecognised under the applicable accounting framework, and by the amount of assets in the defined pension fund which the institution has unrestricted ability to use, provided that the institution has received the prior permission of the competent authority (see further Article 15 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 241/2014.  Contrary to what is assumed in the question, the risk weights are not applied to the 'surplus'  amount but rather to the amount used for reducing the amount to be deducted under Article 36(1)(e) of the CRR.

Annex I paragraph (1) of the CRR mentions that guarantees having the character of \"credit substitutes\" belong to the \"full risk\" category. An example of those kinds of guarantees is also given in the Annex: guarantees for the good payment of credit facilities. It can be deducted from that example that some of the features of a credit substitute are that it is an off-balance sheet obligation and that it carries substantively the same credit risk as a drawn direct credit facility.  In contrast, the term “shipping guarantee” refers to off-balance sheet liabilities such as those that allow a customer to take possession of shipped goods before the shipping company receives the title documents (e.g. the bill of lading), indemnifying the shipping company from losses in case the customer has no valid title on the shipped goods.  If the “guarantee for payment of delivered goods and services” cannot be classified neither as a \"credit substitute\" nor as a \"shipping guarantee\", then it could be analysed whether it meets the trade finance definition in Article 4(1)(80) CRR, as trade finance off balance sheet items are classified as medium or medium/low risk.

The paragraph further alludes to the fact that the operational services are rendered in the context of an established relationship which is critically important to the depositors and also distinguishes between the amount of deposits required to render the operational service in question and deposits in excess of those required.     Legal and operational limitations are limitations that can be due, amongst other limitations, either to the costs and delay of switching by the depositors to another service provider or due to limitations that would arise from a withdrawal of deposits compromising the operational service for which the deposits are a by-product. In order to identify these latter limitations, it is thus important to distinguish between operational deposits and excess deposits.     In order to identify the amount of excess deposits, it is necessary to identify the type of operational services and the amount of deposits required to render these services. The institution needs to develop its own method to estimate these amounts, under the supervision of the relevant competent authority. The method should use factors related to the nature of the service and the client's usage of this service. Any deposits in excess of these amounts should be considered non-operational. Credit institutions shall consider the entire deposit as non-operational where the method referred above has not been carried out or is not completed.     Observed outflows may also be used to corroborate the identification of operational deposits by providing evidence that 'significant withdrawals are unlikely'. However, observed outflows cannot be a sufficient condition to classify deposits as operational deposits.

The purpose of this condition is to ensure that the institution has genuinely received new funds at issuance.  The EBA is mandated in accordance with Article 28 (5) (a) of CRR to develop draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) to specify the applicable forms and nature of indirect funding. The example laid out in this question will have to be assessed against the future RTS to determine whether it has to be considered as direct or indirect funding.  If the criteria set out in the final adopted RTS are met, the following treatment should apply:  At issuance firms exclude the accounting value of the instruments (and associated share premium accounts) in accordance with Article 28 (1)(b) of CRR; this reflects that there is no real increase of capital to add onto the institution 19s balance sheet.  On the basis of the above at issuance the questions 1) to 4) are answered as follows:  CET 1 instruments contribute to CET 1 at their accounting value. In the case an instrument does not meet the CET 1 criteria in Article 28 of CRR, or ceases to meet CET 1 criteria, as set out in Article 30 of CRR, the accounting value of the instrument shall be excluded from contributing towards CET 1. Therefore, where direct or indirect funding has occurred at issuance, the accounting value of the instrument purchased with direct or indirect funding shall be excluded from contributing to CET 1.  1) The amount that the institution shall exclude from CET 1 is the accounting value of the shares, which in this example is 200.  2) Since the amount that is excluded is the accounting value, a change in the market value of the shares has no bearing. Likewise, the amount of the loan relative to the share value has no bearing.  So, in the example, the relevant amount to exclude is still 200.  3) The posting of collateral is not a relevant consideration when judging whether or not direct or indirect funding has occurred. The holding of collateral could become relevant to the extent that the operation qualifies as a synthetic holding under Article 4 (126) of CRR, which is the subject of a separate question (Q\u0026A 2013 009).  4) At issuance, impairment should, in principle, not be of relevance to the extent that the funding/loan cannot be subject to impairment at inception. Where impairment arises, the treatment below will have to be applied.  After initial issuance, where firms directly or indirectly fund the purchase of their own fund instruments, likewise the accounting value of the shares is to be eliminated/derecognised since the issue revolves around the eligibility of the instruments rather than the loan exposure.  Accordingly, the answers to scenarios (1) to (3) would be the same as above. For scenario (4), where the funding/loan is subject to impairment, the amount deducted should be net of any impairment allowance associated with the funding provided.  Accordingly, the amount to be excluded from CET 1 shall be the accounting value of the instrument funded, less any impairment allowance associated with the funding, up to the point that the amount to be excluded nets to zero.  In case the amount of funding provided is higher than the accounting value of the instrument, the impairment amount to be considered should be proportionate to the share of the impairment in the funding.","Article":"4, 28","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":"In Article 3 of the draft RTS on Own Funds, what is the amount to be deducted / not to be considered eligible. If a subscription/acquisition of the institution's shares has been financed by it, what should be the impact and by which amount? There are two possibilities: A) The amount of the funding/loan granted is to be deducted from CET1 (irrespective of the current accounting value of the shares acquired). B) The \"# of shares subscribed/acquired\" times the \"per share accounting amount of total equity\" is not to be given recognition as a positive item of CET1 In case the instruments are not given recognition, what is the amount not to give recognition: A) Amount of the funding given to buy the shares (at the market value); or, B) Corresponding accounting amount of the shares bought (which is different from A if the book value is different from the market capitalization of the institution)? Example: An institution issues capital at par, i.e., book value per share = 100 and market value per share = 100. The share drops in price and is now valued at 80 (new market price). However, this market devaluation does not have a correspondence in the accounting value which remains at 100. The institution finances a customer to buy 2 shares, so finances with 160. Questions 1) Should the institution not recognize as a positive item: 160 (funding given to buy the 2 shares) or 200 (accounting value of the 2 shares whose purchase was financed by the institution) 2) In the example the credit to the issuer is higher than the stock financed and the share increases in value. What amount has to be considered? 3) In the example above, there is collateral posted. What amount has to be considered? Does the treatment change depending on whether the collateral is junior or senior to the delivery of the own shares? 4) In the example above, there is impairment associated with the funding provided (though this one is broadly covered in the article).

The exposure towards the SOV has to be shown in C 29.00 as indirect exposure. In C 28.00 for the GCC consisting of SOV and A, there has to be reported the direct exposure stemming from A, the indirect exposure stemming from the SOV and the effect of CRM stemming from A. The ‘total original exposure’ in C 28.00 is the sum of both C 29.00 for A and the SOV, the position ‘total exposure value after CRM’ (C 28.00, column 330) shows the real existing risk.  Please note that this is not a case of double counting for the purposes of the application of the large exposures limit according to Article 395 (1) of the CRR. Double counting for large exposures purposes would mean that the value of an exposure is assigned twice to the same client. This is not the case here. For the purposes of applying the large exposures limit to the client ‘SOV-A-GCC’, the value of the exposure originally granted to A and then shifted to SOV is counted only once.  In case of any additional GCC the SOV is being member of, e.g. ‘SOV-B-GCC’, the indirect exposure stemming from SOV’s guarantee (towards A) has also to be reported as indirect exposure.

We see the following options:   the indirect exposure towards the SOV is reported for each Group of connected clients (e.g. GCC1 consisting of SOV and entity A and GCC2 consisting of SOV and entity B) and the direct exposure and the effect from credit risk mitigation is reported only to entity A; in this case there is double counting of the exposure (SOV+A) when calculating the original exposure and the exposure before CRM and exemptions of the GCC;  the indirect exposure towards the SOV is reported for each Group of connected clients (e.g. GCC1 consisting of SOV and entity A and GCC2 consisting of SOV and entity B) and the direct exposure to A is omitted (being part of the same GCC): in this case there is no double counting of the exposure (only exposure to SOV);  the indirect exposure towards the SOV is not reported at all while the direct exposure to A is reported (out of the existing intragroup guarantee there is no effect from CRM): in this case there is no double counting of the exposure (only direct exposure to A).

The terms and conditions of the remaining capital are kept unchanged, only the nominal amount is adjusted.

What would the implication for grandfathering be if the contract was unchanged, but the instrument was bought back in increasing amounts each year to avoid paying interests on the part of the instrument not eligible for grandfathering? The formal arrangements of the Tier 1 capital would be unchanged, but this would represent an adoption to the new requirements in line with the situation described in Question 2013_18.

Amongst others it requires disclosure on the carrying amount of transferred financial assets that are not derecognised in their entirety. Assume a situation where an institution enters a combination of several transactions for the same CUSIP: 1. Long position - The institution holds financial assets (e.g., government bonds) amounting to £100. 2. Repo - The institution then sells these securities under a repo agreement and receives cash from its counterparty and recognises a liability to return the cash (for simplicity let us assume it is of the same amount - £100). 3. Short position - The institution also enters into a short position for securities of the same CUSIP amounting to £80. As a result of this combination, the institution presents financial asset amounting to £20 in its balance sheet (difference between long and short positions for the same CUSIP). In the Note to IFRS accounts on transferred assets, the institution discloses £100 as the carrying amount for the transferred assets and £100 for associated liabilities. FINREP does not provide any guidance in respect of the carrying amount to be disclosed in Template 15 in column 10. However, validation rules for column 10 in Template 15 (v0897_m - v0909_m) imply that for the above example an institution shall disclose £20 – i.e. the amount that is presented in the balance sheet (template 1.1) and not the £100 – i.e. the transferred amount. Disclosing £20 does not appear to provide accurate information around the risks associated with transferred assets.

Column 440 of C 06.01 / C 06.02 must not be excluded from (i.e. has to be included in) the ‘combined buffer requirement’ due to the fact that it does not constitute a separate buffer requirement: Article 458 (2) lit. d (iv) CRR rather allows competent authorities to adjust the level of the capital conservation buffer under Article 129 CRD to mitigate the changes in the intensity of risk.  Column 460 is going to be deleted in a future version of the ITS on Supervisory Reporting, as such a buffer does not exist. Accordingly, it does not have to be included in column 410.

The two slices are ranked pari passu rather than one senior and the other subordinated. The way the bank achieves this retention is by signing a derivative contract that only shifts 100-X% of the value of each exposure to the securitisation vehicle. Therefore, X% of the value of each exposure is not transferred to the securitisation vehicle.  The bank claims that the vertical slice retained in the form of securitised exposures is to be treated under the Part 3, Title II, Chapter 3 CRR (the credit risk framework), while the retained remaining slice is to be treated as a securitisation position, within the securitisation framework. Therefore, one exposure is classified at the same time as both an exposure to a corporate, pursuant to Article 147(2)(c) of CRR and a securitisation position, pursuant to Article 147(2)(f) of CRR. However the RWA treatment suggested by the bank does not comply with the principle established in Article 147 of the CRR that an exposure can only be affected to one asset class, so each securitised exposure has to be treated entirely as either an exposure to a corporate or a securitisation position, but not as both at the same time.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59c5e989f2989a3e7c3b290a"},"Article/Paragraph ":"33(5)","Legal act ":"Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR)","Topic ":"Liquidity risk","Background on the question":" Pursuant to Article 33(5)(b) of LCR Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, only credit institutions having a ratio of consumer finance or leasing and factoring activity exceeding 80% of their total balance sheet may receive a waiver in accordance with Article 33(3) and 33(4) as provided under the LCR Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61.  Generally, banks will have to comply with the LCR on an individual and consolidated basis. In a first scenario, imagine a bank constituting a single liquidity subgroup applying for an exemption from the cap on inflows in accordance with Article 33(3) or 33(4) of LCR Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 at consolidated level. In this case, the question is whether Article 33(5)(b) of the LCR Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 refers to the balance sheet value of the individual entities or to the consolidated total balance sheet value of the single liquidity subgroup. We note the EBA response to Q\u0026A 2013_483 (http://www.eba.europa.eu/single-rule-book-qa/-/qna/view/publicId/2013_483) : ‘Where, in accordance with Article 8(1) of the CRR, a competent authority waives the application of liquidity requirements to an institution and to all or some of its subsidiaries, and instead supervises them as single liquidity subgroup, the liquidity subgroup in question shall comply with Part Six on the consolidated basis of that subgroup’.  In a second scenario, imagine a holding entity with some subsidiaries where the holding entity wants to apply for an exemption from the cap on inflows in accordance with Article 33(3) or 33(4) of LCR Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 at individual level. The holding entity, even if specialised in performing leasing and factoring or consumer finance activity, may have a ratio below 80% on an individual basis due to the fact that the balance sheet is inflated by the its shareholding in its subsidiaries (even if these subsidiaries perform the same activity) and refinancing agreements toward these subsidiaries. At consolidated level, the group will comply with the 80% threshold, and on an individual basis, all the entities of the group, apart from the holding entity, comply with the 80% threshold without the exclusion of the above mentioned elements. However, the ratio of the holding company on an individual basis would be above the 80% threshold if we excluded its shareholdings in subsidiaries and internal refinancing agreements from the calculation of the ratio. We consider that these exclusions make sense from a prudential point of view because:  - For the shareholdings in subsidiaries, the subsidiaries of the holding entity are performing the same business and the same activities as the holding entity and all of them have a ratio of main activities (as referred to in article 33(3) or article 33(4)) over total assets above 80%. From an accounting perspective, these shareholdings cannot be seen as consumer finance activity; from a prudential perspective, these are shareholdings in subsidiaries performing consumer finance activities, hence could be considered as consumer finance activities. This is also why at consolidated level and without neutralisation, the group has a much higher “main activities to total balance sheet” ratio. - Internal refinancing agreements are credit lines granted by the holding entity to support its consumer finance subsidiaries and are accounted on-balance sheet. This is due to the fact that in the subgroup, the holding entity supports its subsidiaries in order to have only one main liquidity centre in charge of collecting liquidity for the subgroup. Those refinancing agreements are inflating the balance sheet but are due to liquidity management of the subgroup that permit each subsidiary to focus on consumer finance activities. If they did not exist, each subsidiary would have to collect its own liquidity on the market, hence decreasing the capacity of the holding entity to manage and supervise the liquidity of its subsidiaries.  Considering the abovementioned rationale and the recital 16 of the Delegated Act “…taking into account the existence of specialised business models, certain exemptions to this cap, either full or partial, should be permitted to give effect to the principle of proportionality and subject to the prior approval of the competent authorities….” we are in the view that the purpose of the 80% threshold is to ensure that only credit institutions performing activities as referred to in Article 33(3) or in Article 33(4) may receive this waiver, hence excluding the above mentioned elements for the purpose of the calculation of the ratio should be possible.

The SREP Guidelines state that competent authorities should determine and communicate to an institution its Total SREP Capital Requirement (TSCR), which is determined as the sum of minimum own funds requirements (i.e. 8% if total risk exposure amount) and additional own funds requirements imposed as the outcome of SREP and expressed in TREA. The determination of the absolute amount of TSCR is not affected by the decision of a competent authority on the composition of own funds needed to meet the additional own funds requirements, and therefore should be articulated in terms of all elements forming the minimum own funds requirements (i.e. 8% total own funds, 6% Tier 1 and 4.5% CET1), even in the case when the competent authority determines that additional own funds requirements should be met only by CET1, that is also in line with SREP Guidelines.  Moreover, it should be noted that CET1 instruments must be first used to meet the minimum own funds requirements (including 6% Tier 1 and 8% total own funds requirements in case of any AT1 or Tier 2 shortfall), before the remaining CET1 can contribute to meet the additional own funds CET1 requirements and the combined buffer requirements (in accordance with the stacking order of own fund requirements).  Therefore, the example provided in the question suggests that the overall capital requirement for an institution is 13% of total own funds (8% minimum own funds + 2.5% additional own funds +2.5% combined buffer requirement) and 9.5% of CET1 (4.5% minimum of funds + 2.5% additional own funds + 2.5% combined buffer requirement) as both additional own funds and the combined buffer requirement have to be met by CET1 as per the example. Since in case an institution has a shortfall of AT1 or Tier 2 instruments to meet its total own funds requirements this shortfall should be covered by CET1 instruments both the requirements would act as trigger for calculating the MDA in accordance to the EBA Opinion on the interaction of Pillar 1, Pillar 2 and combined buffer requirements and restrictions on distributions.

T-bills are also liquid instruments by virtue of the Central Bank of Malta which acts as a market-maker for Malta Government T-bills.

For an investment to qualify as a cash equivalent it must be readily convertible to a known amount of cash and be subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

This is so because in table F13.01 only financial guarantees related to loans and advances shall be reported, whereas table F09.02 requires all financial guarantees to be reported, regardless of the asset to which they are related.  Also, there are differences between the reporting of the \"maximum amount of guarantee that can be considered\" in both templates according to paragraphs 63 and 80 of Part 2 of Annex V of the ITS, since for F09.02, the amount is the maximum amount the counterparty could have to pay if the guarantee is called on, and in table F 13.01, the amount of guarantee shall not exceed the carrying amount of the related loan.  Furthermore, in those cases where a loan or advance has several collateral and/or guarantees at the same time, there may be divergences between the amounts reported in template F09.02 and in template F13.02, stemming from the provisions in paragraphs 80 and 82 of Annex V of the ITS.     *As of 1/8/2014 the content of this answer was modified to reflect the publication of the final ITS on supervisory reporting of institutions in the Official Journal of the European Union.

According to Article 234, which is the only Article addressing cases of tranched protection within Part Three Chapter 4, the rules set out in Part Three Chapter 5 shall apply in the event of partial protection and tranching. As the securitisation rules are in this case applied to a securitisation exposure, the question arises whether re-securitisation rules are applicable when the risk weighted exposure amounts of the portions covered and uncovered by the unfunded credit protection are determined. Assuming that an underlying pool of exposures may include only one exposure in accordance with paragraph 542 of the Basel Framework, the covered and uncovered portions of the securitisation could fall under the special treatment for re-securitisation positions as the covered and uncovered portions could both be regarded as an exposure to a securitisation where the risk associated with an underlying pool of exposures is tranched and at least one of the underlying exposures (the protected securitisation position) is a securitisation position. However, treating the portions covered and uncovered by the tranched credit protection as re-securitisation positions does not seem appropriate for the reason that Article 264 as lex specialis also sets out rules regarding the case of tranched protection of a single securitisation position which would be redundant if such tranched protection would generally result in the credit protection being directly regarded as a re-securitisation according to Article 4(63).

The auxiliary promotional transactions are a necessary precondition for a promotional bank to be able to comply with its promotional duty and issue promotional loans in a narrow sense. In general the auxiliary promotional transactions enable promotional banks to comply with prudential requirements (LCR, risk diversification, capital ratio). They also generate earnings that subsidize the promotional loans and cover the administrative costs of the promotional business. In more detail the auxiliary promotional transactions of a promotional bank serve the following purposes (not every bullet applies to every bank) • generation of earnings to reduce interest rates to subsidize promotional business • liquidity management • risk management / risk diversification • coverage of administrative costs • compliance with prudential requirements (liquidity, capital) • generation of earnings to improve capital ratio In consequence all revenues from auxiliary promotional transaction go into the promotional cause. It does not seem possible to assign a specific purpose to a specific transaction since they generally serve several purposes (e.g. compliance with LCR requirements, risk management, generation of earnings to subsidize promotional business) These auxiliary promotional transactions vary from bank to bank but are predominantly securities with high quality such as: • sovereign bonds • blue-chip bonds • securitisations In general, bonds are held to the end of maturity and promotional banks, with one comparatively minor exception, have no trading book assets.

The original aim of the special SME factor is to support SME lending by decreasing the capital requirement of credit institutions through the application of a supporting factor equal to 0,7619. (Preamble 44) Bearing in mind this original goal, it is a question for us, whether credit institutions are entitled to apply the SME factor for specialised lending exposures also (as a subclass of corporate exposures based on Article 147(8) of Regulation No 575/2013 (CRR)), if the conditions laid down in Article 501(2) CRR are met. Even if formally, specialised lending exposures may comply with the conditions regarding categorisation, annual turnover and total exposure, these exposures are not comparable with SME exposures due to their different risk characteristics and profile. In our opinion the conditions currently set in Article 501 CRR for the application of the SME factor are not strict enough to exclude these higher risk specialized lending exposures, e.g. commercial real estate financing, etc. We believe that the favourable treatment of specialised lending exposures (i.e. the application of the SME factor) is not in line with the regulator’s original aim; therefore it would be more prudent, if the application of the SME factor was not allowed for specialised lending exposures. It is also a question for us what the appropriate treatment of specialized lending exposures with regard to the application of the SME factor would be, if a bank under the standard method did not identify a separate sub-segment for specialized lending exposures. We think that the application of the SME factor for specialized lending exposures should be treated the same way (i.e. should not be allowed), no matter if the exposure is in the books of an IRB bank or a standard approach bank.

The same Article specifies that the exposures should be to SMEs defined in accordance with the Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 March 2003, which states that an enterprise is considered to be any entity engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form. This includes, in particular, self-employed persons and family businesses engaged in craft or other activities, and partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity.  Article 147(8) CRR identifies specialized lending as a sub-class of the corporate exposures which possess the following characteristics:  (a) the exposure is to an entity which was created specifically to finance or operate physical assets or is an economically comparable exposure;  (b) the contractual arrangements give the lender a substantial degree of control over the assets and the income that they generate;  (c) the primary source of repayment of the obligation is the income generated by the assets being financed, rather than the independent capacity of a broader commercial enterprise.

However, when reporting single currency positions, this will clearly still lead to an inflow in one currency and an outflow in the other currency, the effect of which, over a 30 day period would be to gross up the balance sheet of material single currency positions.

Take-over bid requirements are within the concept of company law. Indeed, the 13th company law Directive is Directive 2004/25 on take-over bids which is set aside in case of the use of resolution tools and powers by virtue of Article 119 of the BRRD which amends the take-over bids Directive.              As regards the prospectus obligations, BRRD does not amend expressly the prospectus Directive (2003/71 as amended by 2010/73) unlike it does with other EU legislation. Therefore, in principle, both sets of provisions apply. However, the prospectus Directive may not be relevant in the situation described: the prospectus Directive relates to public offering or admission to trading, and in a situation where there is a mandatory conversion of the creditors there is no public offering or admission to trading in that interim. More generally, the set aside of procedural requirements of \"company and securities law\" as per Article 38 (1) should not be read in the absolute but rather be looked at against the rationale of that provision, which is to avoid obstacles to effective and timely resolution.  Disclaimer: This question goes beyond matters of consistent and effective application of the regulatory framework. A Directorate General of the Commission (Directorate General Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union) has prepared the answer, albeit that only the Court of Justice of the European Union can provide definitive interpretations of EU legislation. This is an unofficial opinion of that Directorate General, which the European Banking Authority publishes on its behalf. The answers are not binding on the European Commission as an institution.

For the purpose of calculating own funds requirements for market risks and under certain conditions set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 thereof, a parent institution may within a group use positions in one institution or undertaking to offset positions in another institution or undertaking, thus effectively reducing own funds requirements for market risk. The questions stated here aim at clarifying the meaning and scope of those conditions. In particular, the conditions set forth in Article 325 (2), (3) CRR allow for two interpretations: I. The conditions have to be met for the group as a whole, i. e. not making precise distinctions between those institutions or undertakings, which hold positions that shall actually be offset against each other across legal entities, and those, which do not hold such positions. II. The conditions have to be met only for those institutions or undertakings, which hold positions that shall actually be offset against each other across legal entities. The distinction between these two interpretations is relevant. For example, assume a parent institution P with three subsidiaries A, B and C located in the same country. Further assume the condition in Article 325 (2) point (a) is met with respect to all of them. Finally assume, that only P, A and B operate in a regulatory, legal and conctractual framework that guarantees mutual financial support between them, but C does not. That is, the condition set out in Article 325 (2) point (b) is met only with respect to P, A and B, but not with respect to C. According to interpretation I, there may be no offsetting of positions across legal entities at all. In particular, positions held by A and held by B must not be offset, even if this were feasible with the remaining rules set forth in chapters 2 to 5 of Part III Title IV CRR. According to the interpretation II, there must be no offsetting of positions held by C with any position held by P, A or B. However, positions held by P, A or B may be offset where the remaining rules set forth in chapters 2 to 5 of Part III Title IV CRR are fulfilled. Apparently, interpretation I is more conservative than interpretation II and leads to higher own funds requirements on a consolidated basis by restricting the use offsetting effects.

Article 325(1) specifies that this option is available 18only for the purpose of calculating net positions and own funds requirements in accordance with this Title 19, therefore for market risk only.

Owing to the fact that a new concept is established in one of the Company’s daughter company (“The Daughter Company”), the question rises whether The Daughter Company will be regarded as an Institute and will be included in a consolidated situation. The new concept that will be established implies that The Daughter Company will rent vehicles under a period of 12 (twelve) or 24 (twenty-four) months to a group of persons or companies (operational leasing). This group of persons and companies will create a car pool and will together utilize the vehicle under the rental period. In order for a company to be included in a consolidated situation the specific company must be seen as an institute or a financial institution. An institute is a credit institute or a value paper company. A credit institute is a bank or a credit market company. Before the new legislation it was stated that a financial institution is a company which is not an institute but whose activities covered in the Swedish Act (2004:297) of banking and finance law. In act (2004:297) of banking and finance law it was stated that financial activity is, among other things, participation of financing, for example leasing. This would lead to, before the new legislation, that the rule that governs consolidated situations will be applicable on all leasing activities. Today Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is applicable. In section 1 article 4 in The Regulation definitions are stated. Under paragraph 26, one will find the definition of financial institution. In the definition it is stated that financial institution means an undertaking other than an institution, the principal activity of which is to acquire holdings or to pursue one or more of the activities listed in points 2 to 12 and point 15 of Annex I to Directive 2013/36/EU, including a financial holding company, a mixed financial holding company, a payment institution within the meaning of Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market ( 1 ), and an asset management company, but excluding insurance holding companies and mixed-activity insurance holding companies as defined in point (g) of Article 212(1) of Directive 2009/138/EU. In the annex to the Directive 2013/36/EU under point 2 financial leasing (solely) is stated as an activity that will be covered under a financial institution. This shall be interpreted, in our understanding, that activities with operational leasing solely will not create a consolidated situation between The Company and The Daughter Company.

It is a reference code proposed by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and endorsed by the G20, aimed at achieving a unique and worldwide identification of parties to financial transactions.  The global LEI system is not yet fully operational. However, as an interim solution, a system of pre-LEI codes has been introduced. Pre-LEI codes may be assigned to counterparties by any pre-LOU (pre-Local Operational Unit) that has been endorsed by Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC, detailed information may be found at the following website: www.leiroc.org (http://www.leiroc.org/)). When a pre-LEI code (which is assigned by a recognised pre-LOU) exists for a given counterparty, it should be used in {C 27.00, c030} to identify that counterparty. This would prepare for the full implementation of the LEI system since the pre-LEI codes, as long as they are assigned by a recognised pre-LOU, will become LEI codes.  Meanwhile, when the LEI (or pre-LEI) code of the counterparty is missing, {C 27.00, c030} will be left empty but the institutions should report in column 010 of that template the code of the group of connected clients or of the individual counterparties according to the national reporting system.  The same applies to {C 06.00, c025} and to {F 40.01, c010} regarding entities within the consolidated group.  Reference to the case of Poland.  In Poland there is already a pre-LOU (KDPW S.A.), that had not yet been endorsed by ROC at the date of writing the present answer. KDPW S.A. already assigned pre-LEI codes. However, these codes may be used for regulatory purposes only after ROC endorses KDPW S.A. as globally recognised pre-LOU. The ROC decision regarding KDPW was expected by the end of 2013 or at the beginning of 2014.  Meanwhile, the institutions should report in column 010 of that template the code of the group of connected clients or of the individual counterparties according to the national reporting system. In the case of Poland, it means respectively REGON code (statistical number for business units) and PESEL code (Polish Resident Identification Number for individual clients) for domestic counterparties and EKZ code (Registration for Foreign Clients) foreign counterparties.   ","Article":"394","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":"What does the legal entity identifier exactly mean?

For the transactions listed in Article 224(2) of the CRR, this is not an issue, as the liquidation periods for those transactions are fixed and they coincide with the liquidation periods used in the tables in paragraph 1.  However, an institution may engage in transactions other than those listed in Article 224(2) of the CRR and which have liquidation periods different from those used in Article 224(1). For such cases, institutions cannot determine the applicable volatility adjustment by simply looking at the tables in Article 224(1) of the CRR. Nevertheless, those tables still provide an indication of how institutions should proceed in such cases. Indeed, by examining the tables it can be seen that the volatility adjustments provided therein have been calculated by applying the formula in Article 225(2)(c) of the CRR, using the volatility adjustment for a 10-day liquidation period as the reference and rounding the result to the third decimal place.  In view of the above, for transactions which are not captured by Article 224(2) of the CRR and which have liquidation periods different from those used in Article 224(1), institutions should use the formula in Article 225(2)(c) to adjust the supervisory volatility adjustments provided in the tables in Article 224(1) when faced with liquidation periods that differ in length compared to those laid down in those tables.     DISCLAIMER:  This question goes beyond matters of consistent and effective application of the regulatory framework.

Therefore, applying a conversion factor or a certain percentage in the calculation of the exposure value does not prevent from recognising unfunded credit protection.  When an institution does not use own estimates of LDGs and conversion factors, the CRR prescribes an order for the determination of the covered portion of the exposure value. Per Article 236(3) CRR the exposure value considered for this purpose is to be calculated by applying a conversion factor or percentage of 100% instead of the conversion factors or percentages applicable in the calculation of the exposure value. The covered portion of the exposure value is therefore to be determined in relation to the total value of off-balance sheet items listed in Article 166(8) to (10) CRR.  In contrast, when an institution uses own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors, recognition of unfunded credit protection does not require the separate identification of a covered portion of the exposure value, because risk mitigation by unfunded credit protection may be recognised by directly adjusting PD or LGD estimates in accordance to Article 164(2) CRR. Instead, as prescribed by Article 183(2) CRR, an institution shall have clearly specified criteria to reflect the impact of guarantees.   This would not prevent the institution from considering exclusively the exposure value resulting from the application of the conversion factors or percentages according to Article 166(8) to (10) CRR.

However, Art. 429 CRR has already been replaced by the delegated act on LR (already in place since 18 January 2015). Now, paragraph 2 of Art. 429 clearly states that “institutions shall calculate the leverage ratio at the reporting reference date” (i.e. only end-of-quarter leverage ratio).

Neither is it explained how the relative importance of the different variables included in an internal model for credit risk is to be evaluated. For example, when an external rating is included as one of the risk drivers in a statistical scoring model, it is usually found to be a 'strong' variable (this can be evaluated by several different means, such as information value ordering or by comparing the Wald Chi-2 test statistics). Obviously, if the external rating turns out to be a very dominating variable (say \u003e 90% of the total weight in the model) it should be considered primary.

As the impairment of an available for sale assets is accounted for as a reclassification of the cumulative loss recognised in Other Comprehensive Income from equity to profit or loss (see IAS 39. 67), the amount of specific allowances for individually assessed financial assets is only fed by the remainder portfolios subject to impairment (loans and receivables and held to maturity).  The second set of validation rules proposes to link for equity instruments two concepts which are different among themselves: “accumulated write-offs” as defined in paragraph 49 of Part 2 of Annex V of the ITS and “accumulated impairment “defined in paragraph 47 of Part 2 of Annex V of the ITS.

As clarified in Q\u0026A 1263 (http://www.eba.europa.eu/single-rule-book-qa/-/qna/view/publicId/2014_1263), the treatment of off balance sheet items other than those mentioned in paragraphs (1) to (8) of Article 166 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) is specified in Article 166(10).  Consequently, for off-balance sheet items the use of own estimates of conversion factors is limited to the product types mentioned in Article 166(8)(a) - (d) CRR.  The requirement to use own estimates of conversion factors for retail exposures implies that the conversion factors set out in points (a) to (d) of Article 166(8) CRR can be used only for the exposure classes 'central government and central banks', 'institutions', and 'corporates'.  However, while the retail exposure class is also in the scope of Article 166(8) CRR - to the extent that the first sentence of paragraph (8) refers to own estimates of conversion factors - their use is subsequently limited according to paragraph (10), which refers to items and not to exposure classes.  In case an exposure simultaneously takes the form of a credit line according to Article 166(8) CRR and a credit facility according to Annex I CRR, this exposure does not fall within the scope of Article 166(10) CRR, because it constitutes a product type mentioned in Article 166(8) CRR.","Article":"166","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":" For which product types has a credit conversion factor (CCF) to be used in the retail exposure class, which is based on own estimates?"}

Unless in some cases, there is no capital guarantee in case the client chose to invest in units of account. The client takes then the economic risk related to his investment. An insurance subsidiary of a bank would like to underwrite a T2 instrument of its parent company in order to place it on its clients’ units of account. It seems to us that this would not be CRR compliant for the following reasons: - From a legal point of view, the insurance subsidiary remains the owner of the instrument placed in units of account. This goes against Article 63(b) CRR which prohibits the subscription of a T2 instrument by a subsidiary or any undertaking in which the institution has participation in the form of ownership, direct or by way of control, of 20% or more of the voting rights or capital of that undertaking; - The parent bank suggests to commit to buyback the part of the instrument for market making purposes in case the client ask reimbursement of its instrument and the insurance company is not able to replace the instrument in another client’s account (according to the bank, very rare cases). However, this would go against Article 63(k) CRR which prohibits the issuer to explicitly or implicitly indicate that the instrument would or might be repurchased other than in insolvency or liquidation. Moreover, this kind of buyback cannot be treated as market making purchases, as the instrument would be cancelled and not sold back to the market. - If we consider that the client is the owner of the instrument, from an economic point of view, then it would go against Article 63(i) which requires that all call options are exercisable only at the sole discretion of the issuer. However the underwriting would be possible by a subsidiary or branch as long as the instrument is immediately replaced in the market and subscribed by an external investor. The instrument is not taken into account in the parent company’s own funds as long as the instrument is not resold. Similarly, an insurance company could place a T2 instrument in units of account of its clients’ life insurance policies as long as this insurance company is not the subsidiary of the issuer, or an undertaking on which the issuer has participation in the form of ownership, direct or by way of control, of 20% or more of the voting rights or capital.

Following the above, the underwriting of a Tier 2 instrument of an institution by an insurance subsidiary, which places the instrument in unit-linked funds within life insurance policies, would result in disqualification of the Tier 2 instrument from the issuer’s Own Funds, as long as the insurance subsidiary remains the legal owner of  the instrument.

Even most long term deposits (of governments or large corporations not excluded from MREL-eligible liabilities) with a remaining maturity of more than one year can be asked to be paid back immediately (losing only the interest), making ’this moment’ the earliest reimbursement. Approach 1: Strict interpretation Where deposits (or other liabilities) can be broken up at any time, it means that its owner has a right for early reimbursement and the remaining maturity is zero days (or 1-2 days if the owner requires the amount in cash), that’s why deposits which can be asked to be paid back before maturity cannot be included in the amount of own funds and eligible liabilities meeting MREL. Rationale for approach 1: The BRRD is clear on the definition of maturity, and this approach results in a harmonised definition across the EU. However, this approach significantly narrows the amount of deposits that can be included in the amount of own funds and eligible liabilities meeting MREL. Approach 2: Expanded interpretation In order to include deposits with a remaining maturity of at least 1 year but which can be withdrawn at any time, a definition of ’stable deposits’ shall be used similar to the one used for the purpose of Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), specified in Regulation 575/2013 (CRR). Stable deposits can be included if a depositor has to pay a material penalty (in excess of interest lost) (CRR 421 (5)) when withdrawing the deposit. Rationale for Approach 2: With the definition used in Approach 2 more deposits can be included in the amount of own funds and eligible liabilities meeting MREL, but also a criterium applies that those the depositor has a strong incentive not to withdraw the deposit before maturity. However, this approach is more complicated to (eg. materiality of penalty), furthermore the LCR definition refers only to retail deposits while DGS-eligible retail deposits are excluded from the amount meeting MREL.

The impossibility to exercise the call (during the whole period between 31 December 2011 and 1 January 2013) due to state aid rules may indeed be interpreted as a legal obstacle which is relevant for the purposes of Article 489(5)(a) for determining whether the institution was able to exercise the call.  Article 491(a) refers to the date of the first call date of an instrument with an incentive to redeem occurring on or after 1 January 2013. Since Article 491(a) explicitly defines effective maturity for the purpose of Articles 489 and 490, it should be read in conjunction with those Articles. Therefore, a call date should be interpreted as a date on which an institution was able to exercise a call.

Within F 05.00, the outstanding amount of the loans shall be reported, while in F 13.01, it is the amount of the collateral that shall be declared capped by the amount of the loan. Nonetheless, paragraph 2.81 of Annex V of the ITS states that \"The sum of the amounts of a financial guarantee and/or collateral shown in the related columns of template 13.1 shall not exceed the carrying amount of the related loan. \". That means that the validation rule v1074_m shall be expressed with the sign \"\u003c= \", that is, sum({F 13.01, r010, (c010-020)}) \u003c= sum({F 05.00, r090, (c020-060)}.      v1235_m  {F 46.00, r010, c100} = {F 46.00, r210, c100} t-1   The validation rule is correct and shall not be changed.      v1350_m  sum({F 20.03, r120, (c010-020)}) = {F 02.00, r320,c010}   The cell {F 02.00, r320, c010} exists in Annex IV for institutions reporting according to national GAAP and does not exist in Annex III for IFRS institutions. It must be noted that some validation rules apply only to Annex IV set of templates. Therefore, the validation rule is correct and shall not be changed.     v1324_m  {F 46.00, r010, c100} = {F 01.03, r250, c010} t-1.  These two templates have different reporting frequencies: F01.03, quarterly; F46.00, annual. Therefore, the validation rule works only if the amount included in the template 46 is compared to the template F 01.03 prepared at the previous financial year-end. The reference to IAS 27.28 is justified in that it concerns the allocation of net income and comprehensive income.      V0786_m   These two templates are quarterly and have the same reporting date. Therefore, we confirm that the amount of \" Profit or loss attributable to owners of the parent\" should be the same in the two statements. Additionally, the reference to IAS 1.83 (a)(ii) in {F 01.03, r250, c010} and {F 02.00, r690, c010} shall be replaced with a reference to IAS 81B (b) (ii) in next available version of the ITS      v1236_m  {F 46.00, r010, c110} = {F 46.00, r210, c110} t-1   This validation rule shall not be amended.

Therefore, this validation rule is, from a certain point of view, equivalent to v1236_m.     Example of reporting interim dividends at the end of the year and the distribution of previous year earnings in F 46.00 (see attached file)   An institution with 100 ac Profit and loss in year (n-1) with interim dividends of 20 ac should register 100 ac in {F 46.00, r010, c100} and -20 ac in {F 46.00, r010, c110}.  When this institution agrees in year n a total dividend of 50 ac (20 ac already paid in year n-1 and 30 additional dividends to be paid in year n), retaining the remaining earnings, it should be reported in F 46.00 in the following way:       ","Attachments":"  Q 512 Image.docx (http://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180//210008//477437_Q+512+Image.docx)  ","Article":"99","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":"There are several validations that do not appear to work given the contents of the cells referenced. Can you please advise as to the appropriate treatment for these items? 1. v1074_m This validation requires the sum of the counterparty split of mortgage loans [Loans collateralized by immovable property] on Table 5 to equal the sum of Row 10 columns 10 and 20 on Table 13, which represents residential and commercial Mortgage loans [Loans collateralized by immovable property]. sum({F 13.01, r010, (c010-020)}) = sum({F 05.00, r090, (c020-060)}) However, the instructions to Table 5 indicate that the loan balances should be reported in this table. In Template 13.1, the “maximum amount of the collateral or guarantee that can be considered” shall be reported. The sum of the amounts of a financial guarantee and/or collateral shown in the related columns of template 13.1 shall not exceed the carrying amount of the related loan. Therefore, the validation does not seem to be appropriate given the loan balance may not be equal to the amount of the guarantee/collateral. 2. v1235_m This validation requires that the opening balance of Profit/loss Attributable to owners of the parent equal the closing balance from the prior year. {F 46.00, r010, c100} = {F 46.00, r210, c100} t-1 However, as this is a p\u0026l column, the opening balance should always be 0 as the p\u0026l is rolled into retained earnings every year. 3. v1350_m This validation formula references Table 2 row 320, however this row does not exist. sum({F 20.03, r120, (c010-020)}) = {F 02.00, r320,c010} 4. v1324_m This validation states the opening balance of Profit/loss Attributable to owners of the parent per the Statement of Changes in Equity should equal Profit/loss Attributable to owners of the parent on the balance sheet from the prior period. The FAQ's released by the EBA in March stated \"Templates referring to a period shall be reported cumulatively from the first day of the accounting year to the reference date.\" {F 46.00, r010, c100} = {F 01.03, r250, c010} t-1. We do not understand the reference to IAS 27.28. The validation v0786_m states that Profit/loss Attributable to owners of the parent is an income statement measure as it validates to the Statement of Profit or Loss. As a p\u0026l measure would get closed out into retained earnings at the end of each year, this validation does not appear to work. Is the EBA intending Table 1.3 row 250 to represent p\u0026l for the year? The reference to IAS1.83(a)(ii) is invalid as it has been removed from the standard. Is the EBA intending Table 1.3 row 250 to represent p\u0026l for the year? The reference to IAS1.83(a)(ii) is invalid as it has been removed from the standard. 5. v1236_m This validation requires that the opening balance of Interim Dividends equal the closing balance from the prior year {F 46.00, r010, c110} = {F 46.00, r210, c110} t-1 Is this supposed to represent the balance sheet value of accrued but not paid dividends? 6. v1325_m This validation states the opening balance of Interim Dividends per the Statement of Changes in Equity should equal Interim Dividends on the balance sheet from the prior year. Is this supposed to represent cumulative distributions or distributions for the year? If the latter, the validation does not work. {F 46.00, r010, c110} = {F 01.03, r260, c010} t-1"}

A potential change to the schedule that would solely depend on a prolongation decision by the institution need not be taken into account when determining M. Were this required, the institution may have difficulty to applying a formula which is based on a fixed schedule. Where an institution is not in a position to calculate M as set out in Article 162(2)(a) of the CRR, it is instead required by Article 162(2)(f) to determine M as the maximum remaining time (in years) that the obligor is permitted to take to fully discharge its contractual obligations, where M shall be at least 1 year. Consequently, where the obligor is not in the position to prolong the time permitted to take to fully discharge its contractual obligations, the institution is still not required to use an M that is longer than according to the original schedule.  In conclusion, considering a longer maturity resulting from a prolongation by the institution instead of the original schedule is neither required by point (a), nor by point (f), of Article 162(2) of the CRR. This makes clear that a longer maturity that could result from potential changes to the schedule solely because of a prolongation decision by the institution need not be taken into account before the institution has made such a decision.

Systemic risk is expected to be lower where a counterparty is both  (i) subject to a high standard of prudential regulatory oversight; and  (ii) relatively small. ‘Prudential regulation’ is not defined – on a very limited view, it could be read as meaning firms subject to risk-based capital requirements via CRR (banks and investment firms) and Solvency II (insurers). However, funds are also subject to extensive regulatory requirements, including restrictions on leverage, which should also limit their systemic risk.     We are not seeking clarification on the treatment of exposures in the form of units or shares in CIUs according to Article 152 CRR. The type of activity that prompted our question is:  (i) lending to the CIU, either on a secured or senior unsecured basis; and  (ii) counterparty risk exposure on OTC derivatives with the CIU.     These are credit and counterparty risk exposures that are distinct from holding units or shares in the CIU. The bank’s lending/derivative trading with the CIU does not convey any ownership interest, we are transacting with the CIU in the same way as any other customers. In the event of the CIU’s insolvency or default, our claim would rank senior to those holding units or shares in the CIU.     CIUs may borrow from the credit institution in order to meet their day-to-day cashflow needs, or to leverage their returns (within the investment mandate agreed for each CIU). CIUs may enter into derivative transactions with us as outright trading positions; alternatively, they may do so in order to hedge risks associated with their asset holdings.     Although it is the investment management company that will set up these arrangements they are doing so on the CIU’s behalf; the bank’s contractual counterparty as a bank is the CIU itself – the bank has no recourse to the management company. It is therefore the CIU’s credit risk that is relevant for calculating the bank’s risk-weighted exposure amounts. The bank does so using CRR Article 153, hence the need to consider whether the 1.25 multiplier applies under Article 153(2).

Hence, an institution may choose not to nominate any ECAI at all, or to nominate one or more ECAIs with a view to use their credit assessments for all of its exposures for which the use of external credit assessments is allowed under the standardised approach or for particular classes of items.  Once one or more ECAIs are nominated, the institution cannot disregard the credit assessments issued by the nominated ECAIs. Article 138 CRR explicitly requires credit assessments not to be used selectively, whereas Article 121 CRR applies only when credit assessments by a nominated ECAI are not available. Should such credit assessments be available, the institution is obliged to use them and apply Article 120 CRR.  An institution also has the possibility to revoke the nomination of an ECAI under Article 138 CRR. Should there be concrete indications that such a revocation is triggered by an intention to reduce capital adequacy requirements, the institution is obliged to substantiate the revocation by way of explanation to the relevant competent authority.

Regarding the quantitative requirements banks have to calculate and report, on monthly basis, to the CNB the minimum liquidity coefficient (MLC). It is similar to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), it looks inflow and outflows in one month horizon under stress scenario determined by the supervisor. This minimum liquidity coefficient is calculated by dividing liquidity inflows (including liquid assets) with liquidity outflows and the result has to be equal or greater than 1. According to the Article 412 (5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 the Member States may maintain or introduce national provisions in the area of liquidity requirements before binding minimum standards for liquidity coverage requirements are specified and fully introduced in the Union in accordance with Article 460. Therefore we have two questions: 1) Our understanding of Article 412 (5) is that we may maintain our Decision on liquidity risk management until 2018 (or even 2019 - according to article 460(2)) when the LCR is fully introduced in the Union (i.e. LCR = 100%) Is this correct reading? 2) We are not sure how to understand the second part of Article 412 (5) which says: Member states or competent authorities may require domestically authorised institutions, or a subset of those institutions to maintain a liquidity coverage requirement up to 100% until the binding minimum standard is fully introduced at a rate of 100% in accordance with Article 460. Can we keep our minimum liquidity coefficient unchanged, or we have to change it based on phasing-in process from 2015 so that both LCR and our MLC equals 100%, i.e. in 2015 LCR = 60% and MLC = 40%, and so on. Although it will be difficult to calculate due to different formula, haircuts and maybe scope. But on the other hand if we maintain MLC unchanged and introduce LCR (first 60%, 70%...) than our banks will have double requirements. Or this does not have anything to do with national liquidity requirements but with the fact that Member states may introduce LCR at 100% even before 2018?"}

For example, each person has to be considered individually, to ensure compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  The reasoning is the same as in Article 111 of Directive 2014/59/EU (BRRD) (Removal would affect the individual’s rights under Article 8 and Article A1P1 ECHR, so must be done in a manner compatible with the Convention).

As regards the level of implementation of the provision, ECHR issues will very much depend on the nature of the decision that is taken in the Member State as regards the removal of the senior management/board. If it is not a ”penalty”, there would not appear to be an issue of ECHR. Even if it were viewed as a penalty, it would be necessary to look at the nature of the penalty (administrative / criminal) and whether it is proportionate and justified. Also, this power should be viewed as a power available to a competent authority (to replace the senior management or the management body) before it considers an even more interventionist power, i.e. the appointment of temporary administrator (who will take on some or all of the powers of the management body) is exercised.  At the same time, it was intended as a stronger power than that included in Article 27(1)(d) of Directive 2014/59/EU (BRRD) when persons are found unfit to perform their duties under CRD or CDR IV since it allows for the removal of senior management or management body in its entirety when the relevant conditions are met, namely that there is a significant deterioration in the financial situation or serious infringements of law etc. or serious administrative irregularities. In these instances Article 28 BRRD assumes that the senior management in its entirety is unfit to run the bank and to solve the problems of the institution. In practical terms, whether each person is considered individually or not (to comply with ECHR), the rationale is the ability for the competent authority to remove senior management or management body in its entirety, provided that the relevant conditions are met.

Our understanding is that the initial exposure of the aforementioned transactions shall not be null whereas its respective exposure at default shall be zeroed out. On top of creating unjustified discrepancies between Initial Exposure and EAD values, the treatment does not seem to fit the Corep logics nor its structure. It is mainly due to the fact that on balance sheet exposure type, we have zero EAD facing some initial exposures on those type of transactions.  It raises the following blocking errors: v0010_h, v0306_m, v0307_m, v0308_m, v0312_m. The latter control refers to a mismatch between the EAD values by exposure type and the sum of EAD values broken down by risk weight. In order to bypass the blocking errors, we have made the decision to align the EAD values with their respective Initial Exposure amounts. As amounts involved are quite significant and because this treatment impacts a broader spectrum of reporting (Concentration Risk and STE, for example), your input is very much needed at this point.’ ","Permanent link":"link (http://www.eba.europa.eu/single-rule-book-qa/-/qna/view/publicId/2016_3064)","Subparagraph":"","Question ID":"2016_3064","identifier":"2016_3064","Published as Final Q\u0026A":{"$date":"2017-04-07T00:00:00.000Z"},"COM Delegated or Implementing Acts/EBA RTS/EBA ITS/EBA GLs":"Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 - ITS on supervisory reporting of institutions (as amended) ","Date of submission":{"$date":"2016-12-21T00:00:00.000Z"},"Paragraph":"","Subject matter ":"Exposures towards QCCPs under CRR Art. 306(c) under standardised method","EBA answer":" According to Article 306 (1) lit. c) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), the exposure value of a transaction with the CCP is zero, when the institution is acting as a financial intermediary between a client and a CCP and the terms of the CCP-related transaction state that the institution is not obligated to reimburse the client for any losses suffered due to changes in the value of that transaction in the event that the CCP defaults.

The holding company has in turn a 100% stake in a bank subsidiary in the same third country. This subsidiary is referred to in Article 81(1) of the Regulation. In addition, both the bank subsidiary and the holding company are fully included in the prudential consolidation of the EU parent company.  The own funds of the bank subsidiary, which amounts to 1000, are mainly compounded by capital and accumulated reserves and account for local capital requirements. The holding company balance sheet is composed of the participation in the bank subsidiary and some liquidity.  For the EU Parent company, the amount of the indirect minority interests that arise from the bank subsidiary are equal to the local partner’s share in the bank subsidiary, multiplied by the own funds of the subsidiary. (Indirect minority interest = 49% *100%*1000= 490).  Minority interests are defined in Article 4(1)(120) of the CRR as the amount of Common capital tier 1 capital of a subsidiary of an institution that is attributable to natural or legal persons other than those included in the prudential scope of consolidation of the institution.  According to Article 81 the minority interest, as previously defined, arising from the participation in bank subsidiaries in third countries, which are fully included in the consolidation ,and owned by third parties should be included in the consolidated own funds.  From those articles, it is clear that:  • Those minority interests arise from that bank subsidiary.  • The CRR in Article 4(1)(120) when defining the term “minority interest” does consider the amount of the instruments “attributable” to third parties, and in this sense, both direct and indirect minority interests are considered within the definition of the term minority interest.  • The “attributable amount” comprises capital and reserves (CET1 capital) that have been accumulated in the bank subsidiary and that belong to third parties beyond the scope of the consolidation.  • The CET1 capital is allocated at the bank subsidiary. This CET1 capital is funding the bank subsidiary’s RWA, and accounts for local solvency requirements that are under the supervision of the bank subsidiary supervisor. In addition to this, the bank subsidiary’s RWA are considered in the group’s consolidated accounts.

It must be noted that the reporting obligation starts in 2014; this is independent from the fact that the institution specific countercyclical capital buffer is applicable from 2016 onwards.

This means that measures with effects on the capital ratios, that are based on Article 104 (2) CRD are reflected in these cells. Measures or requirements that are not based on this specific Article are not reflected. This includes buffer requirements in accordance with Articles 128 to 140 CRD or Article 458(2) point d (iv) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), that are only reflected in C 04.00, rows 740 to 810, applicable columns of C 06.01 / C 06.02 and C 09.03 or C 09.04 of Annex I of the ITS on Supervisory Reporting.  Question 1)  A capital conservation buffer in accordance with Article 128 (1) CRD is not reflected in rows 070 – 120 of template C 03.00 of Annex I of the ITS on Supervisory Reporting in any case (i.e. neither when an additional Pillar II requirement in accordance with Article 104 (2) CRD is imposed nor when no Pillar II requirements are set). Thus, the corresponding amount – i.e. the own funds needed to fulfil the capital conservation buffer requirement as of the reporting reference date – should be reported exclusively in row 750 of C 04.00 of Annex I of the ITS on Supervisory Reporting.  Question 2)  An institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer in accordance with Article 128 (2) CRD is reported in C 04.00, row 770 (corresponding amount as applicable at the reporting reference date).  In case the requirement is different from the buffer requirement of Art. 128 point (2) of CRD and is imposed by the competent authority pursuant to Article 104 (2) CRD, this buffer shall be reflected in C 03.00.  It then depends on the requirements of the competent authority whether rows 070, 090 and 110 or rows 080, 100 and 120 have to be filled. The competent authority should clarify whether the imposed target ratio is only related to the CET 1 ratio or also to T1 ratio and / or total capital ratio.  In case the competent authority requires the institution to fulfil a specific target ratio, this is reported in rows 080, 100 and / or 120 of C 03.00, as applicable.  If the competent authority requires the institution to calculate additional own funds requirements for Pillar II reasons in accordance with Article 104 (2) CRD, then these additional own funds requirements have to be reported in C 04.00, row 820 and the capital ratios including these adjustments have to be reported in C 03.00, rows 070, 090 and 110.

We are seeking clarity that a guarantee or credit default swap, which transfer the risk on an instrument to another party, may be considered a short position in the non trading book. The party providing the guarantee or credit default swap would then have a synthetic holding in the financial institution capital instrument. CRR also considers indirect holdings of financial institution capital instruments. The definition in Article 4(1)(114) is focused on long holdings because of its reference to the “loss” that would be incurred on a long holding, rather than the gain that would be experienced on any short holding.

This also limits the scope of application of the IGFS Chapter to those intra-group financing agreements that are set up to support institutions. However, if such IGFS agreement envisages the provision of financial support not only to institutions that meet the conditions for early intervention but also to other group entities, it is still subject to authorisation (the exemption requires that \"none of the parties\" meets the conditions for early intervention). If, on the basis of such IGFS agreement, one party considers to grant financial support to another party that is not an institution, the competent authority may, however, not oppose such financial support under Article 25. Given the authorisation requirement under Article 20, a broader scope of application that would include business-as-usual financial support agreements (such as guarantees, letters of comfort) would not seem in line with the purpose of facilitating intra-group financial support.

The first year of last five years has just passed (four years left to maturity), so the institution is required to amortize the nominal using the rate of 20%, i.e. PLN 20 m.

According to the interpretation adopted by the institution, the amount of the instrument classified as Tier 2 capital is still 80 m (PLN 100m x 80%), and thus, the repayment PLN 20 m has no effect on it.

In particular: Article 105: (i) Establishes the obligation to evaluate trading book position prudently (paragraph 1) and gives some criteria (para 11-13); ii) gives to EBA the mandate to draft RTS on prudent valuation (para 14). Article 34 states that additional value adjustments (calculated according to article 105): i) shall apply to all fair value positions (and not only to the trading book); ii) shall be deduced from CET1 capital.  The final draft of the RTS put forward two approaches for the implementation of the prudent valuation. The usage of the two different approaches depends on a threshold that must be considered at group/consolidated level (not individual level). The prudent valuation requirements apply to all fair-valued positions regardless of whether they are held in the trading book or banking book.  1. Simplified approach: Under this approach the calculation of the required AVA is based on a percentage (0.1%) of the aggregate absolute value of fair-valued positions held by the institution (this adjustment covers all AVAs requirements). Institutions may apply the simplified approach, provided the sum of the absolute value of fair-valued assets and liabilities (only those that whose changes impact CET1 capital) is less than EUR 15 billion. For assets/liabilities for which a change in accounting valuation has only a partial or zero impact on Common Equity Tier 1 capital, AVAs should be applied based on the proportion of the accounting valuation change that impacts Common Equity Tier 1 capital. These include: positions subject to hedge accounting; Available-For-Sale positions to the extent their valuation changes are subject to a prudential filter; and exactly matching, offsetting positions (art. 105 (14) point 3; EBA RTS final draft).  2. Core approach: It is compulsory for institutions that are above the threshold of the simplified. The core approach of the RTS has the following key features: (i) each AVA shall be calculated as the excess of valuation adjustments required to achieve the identified prudent value over any adjustments applied in the institution’s fair value adjustment that can be identified as addressing the same source of valuation uncertainty as the AVA; (ii) where possible, the prudent value of a position is linked to a range of plausible values and a specified target level of certainty (90%). In practical terms, this means that for the following AVAs: i) Market price uncertainty; ii) Close-out costs; and iii) Unearned credit spreads institutions are required to calculate the prudent value using market data and the specified target level of certainty; (iii) in all other cases, an expert-based approach is specified, together with the key factors that are required to be included in that approach. In these cases the same target level of certainty as above (90%) is set for the calibration of the AVAs.

It should be clarified that, where the application of prudent valuation would lead to a lower carrying value than actually recognised in the accounting, the absolute value of the difference should be deducted from own funds.’  Accordingly, all fair valued positions, assets and liabilities, whether in the trading book or non-trading book (banking book) of institutions, are within the scope of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/101 (RTS). In particular, this includes all positions under the Fair Value Option and Available for Sale, though these two types of positions are normally included in the banking book. As per Recital 1 of the RTS, the term ‘positions’ is, however, understood as solely referring to financial instruments and commodities, which results, in particular, in the exclusion from the scope of the RTS of investment properties that may be measured at fair value in accordance with IAS40.  Throughout the RTS, ‘fair value’ (FV) should refer to the definition of fair value and the applicable measurement requirements under IFRS 13 and IAS 39 for banks that are required or chose to use the IFRS framework as endorsed by the EU (c.f. Regulation (EU) 1606/2002), or to the definition of fair value in national GAAPs as set out under Article 8(7) of Directive 2013/34/EU. The assumption is that trading book positions should always be fair valued but, in case national GAAPs allow for a different treatment, such positions will not be subject to the prudent valuation requirements if they are not measured at fair value.  In accordance with Recital 3 and Articles 4 \u0026 8 of the RTS, a consistent treatment has to be applied for:  -          Determination of the threshold  -          AVA calculation  The approach should also be consistent in all cases: 1) exactly ‘matching, offsetting positions’, 2) positions subject to hedge accounting; and 3) positions subject to the use of prudential filters.     Exactly matching, offsetting positions  In accordance with the RTS, exactly matching, offsetting assets and liabilities are excluded from both the determination of the threshold and the AVAs calculations.  Exactly matching, offsetting assets and liabilities should be read strictly and hence are positions for which all contractual future cash flows are identical and in opposite direction under all circumstances.  Back to back derivative transactions are eligible as long as they fulfil the above criteria.     Positions subject to hedge accounting  The overarching criterion is the one established in Article 4(2) of the RTS and is applicable to all fair valued positions within the scope of the RTS, including positions under the Fair Value Option and Available for Sale:     ‘For fair-valued assets and liabilities for which a change in accounting valuation has a partial or zero impact on Common Equity Tier 1 (‘CET1’) capital, their values shall only be included in proportion to the impact of the relevant valuation change on CET1 capital.’  Accordingly, if there is an accounting hedge, the bank must consider the proportion that the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument(s) that are not offset by the symmetric change in the fair value of the hedged item(i.e. the FV change that would have an impact on CET1).  These changes in value must be computed by comparing the FV of the instruments at the current reporting date with the one obtained for the last CET1 reporting date, or since the instrument was originally traded if it occurred within the reporting period.  Accordingly, since this proportion will vary during the life of the accounting hedge, it must be updated on every CET1 reporting date.  Once the proportion that the residual impact in CET1 represents is determined, the institution should multiply it by the absolute value of the fair value of assets and liabilities/derivatives that comprise the accounting hedge to compute the simplified approach threshold. This proportion should also be used when computing the AVAs for the instruments included in the accounting hedge.     ‘Economic’ hedges  It should be noted that, according to the RTS, only hedging recognised under accounting rules can be considered, hence ‘economic hedges’ are not recognised under this provision. Nevertheless, due to the way AVAs are computed under the core approach, ‘economic hedges’ may induce lower AVAs in practice, where positions are offset by one another, though it is clear that under the simplified approach all positions receive an AVA.     Cash flow hedges (according to Article 33(1)(a) CRR)  It should also be noted that only accounting hedges that reduce the impact of a market movement in CET1 are acceptable. Accordingly, the derivative instrument included in a ‘Cash flow hedge’ would have to be fully considered, since the establishment of a cash flow hedge generates an ‘impact’ on CET1 for a position that previously would not have had such an impact. In the end, due to the application of prudential filters, these positions are excluded, since, according to Article 33(1)(a) of the CRR, the fair value reserves related to gains or losses stemming from ‘cash flow hedges’ of financial instruments not valued at fair value are filtered out of CET1.     Hedging of an individual risk factor (‘valuation input’ in the RTS)  In the case that the accounting hedge is for a specific risk factor of the hedged instrument, (i.e. hedge only the interest rate component of a corporate bond, leaving the credit spread open) the bank must also perform a similar calculation as described in the general approach but at the level of the risk factor.  In this case, the proportion that the changes – i.e. the changes in the risk factors that had an impact on CET1 - represent when compared with all changes in the instruments’ risk factors, must be taken in absolute value (i.e. regardless of whether there was a loss or a gain) to determine the proportion for the threshold. This proportion should be used both to compute the threshold used for the simplified approach as well as to determine the AVAs according to the simplified approach.  However, the proportion of the AVAs to be applied under the core approach has to be computed by risk factor (‘valuation input’ according to the terminology of the RTS).     Application of prudential filters  The same procedure should be applied for prudential filters; in case the change in the value of an instrument (such as AFS assets) is filtered out of CET1, then the proportion that is filtered out should not be considered when computing the standardised threshold nor when calculating the AVAs.  In the case that it is not the change in value of the instrument as a whole, but only the change in a particular risk factor that is filtered out, such as with the bank’s own credit worthiness for a liability at FV (Article 33(1)(b) of the CRR), the percentage of the change for the risk factor would be the part which is not filtered out (under the current treatment 100% is currently filtered for own credit worthiness, so 0% would be considered).  Just like in the previous case (hedging of an individual risk factor), the proportion that the changes in the risk factors that had an impact on CET1 represent when compared with all changes in the instruments’ risk factors must be taken in absolute value (i.e. regardless of whether there was a loss or a gain) to determine the proportion for the threshold. This proportion should be used both to compute the threshold used for the simplified approach as well as to determine the AVAs according to the simplified approach.  However, the proportion of the AVAs to be applied under the core approach may be computed by risk factor (‘valuation input’ according to the terminology of the RTS). In the specific case of the own credit worthiness the proportion to be considered would be 0% since 100% is filtered out according to Article 33(1)(b) of the CRR.     Fallback treatment  Every time CET1 is reported, the above calculations have to be performed in order to apply any reduction in the computation of both the threshold and/or individual AVAs. In case it is not possible to perform the calculations, the institution shall apply the most conservative approach, i.e. compute 100% of the value of the instrument(s) and relevant AVAs.     Examples  Example 1 - accounting hedge of an individual risk factor (‘valuation input’ in the RTS): fixed coupon Corporate Bond bought for 100, the bank does an accounting hedge of the interest rate of the bond, but leaves the credit spread risk open.  At the end of the quarter the bond is worth 98, and the (bond + hedge) is worth 102 due to the following market changes:  Interest rate:            - 5 in the value of the bond        +4 in the value of the hedge  Credit spread:        + 3 in the value of the bond     Proportion to be used for threshold:  (ABS (-5 + 4) + ABS (+3)) / (ABS(-5) + ABS(+3)) = 50%  to be applied to the value of the bond at the end of the quarter (102)     Proportion to be used to determine AVAs by risk factor (‘valuation input’ according to the terminology of the RTS):  Interest rate: ABS ( -5 + 4) / ABS(-5) = 20%     Example 2 - application of prudential filters: 5 year fixed bond issued at 100 by the bank. Valued at FV (FV option)   At the end of the quarter the value of this liability is 101 due to the following movements:  Improvement in the firm’s own credit worthiness:        + 3 in the value of the bond (loss)  Increase in interest rates:                                                   - 2 in the value of the bond (gain)     The own credit worthiness is 100% filtered out, so the proportion to be used for threshold would be:  (ABS (3 - 3) + ABS (-2)) / (ABS(+3) + ABS(-2)) = 40% to be applied to the value of the bond at the end of the quarter (101)     Proportion to be used to determine AVAs by risk factor (‘valuation input’ according to the terminology of the RTS):  Interest rate: there is no filter for this ‘valuation input’, so 100%  Credit spread: 100% is filtered, so 0%     Example 3 - hedge accounting: fixed rate mortgage portfolio hedged using an interest rate swap that is held at fair value and is currently an asset worth €50m.   This is designated as a fair value hedge for accounting with an effective proportion of 90%.  The effect on CET1 of any change in value of the swap is only (100% - 90% =) 10% of that change in value. Therefore only 10% of the asset value (€5m) counts towards the threshold for the simplified approach.  Similarly any AVA on the full value of the swap is multiplied by 10% before being added to the total AVA for the bank.     See also Q\u0026A 2013 213 (https://www.eba.europa.eu/single-rule-book-qa/-/qna/view/publicId/2013_213).","Article":"105","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":" We are interested in knowing:  1. If for the calculation of the thresholds asset and Liabilities under the FVO regime have to be (proportionally) taken into account (indeed, EBA RTS does not explicitly include them within the list of valuation positions for which a proportional calculation of the threshold can be applied- see EBA RTS introduction notes, subsection 3; on the other hand the EBA RTS does not explicitly excluded them). According to our view the answer to this question is yes (art. 34 states that additional value adjustments - calculated according to article 105 - shall apply to all fair value positions and not only to the trading book).  2. If the answer to question 1) is yes then we are interest in knowing how to calculate the part that should be taken into account (i.e. the part that is not deriving from the own credit spread movements; the part that has an impact on CET1); we would like to know the criterion that should be used in order to calculate the “proportional part” of these stocks (of asset or liabilities) that is impacting the CET 1.  3. If the answer to question 1 is yes and if the bank hedges the “the interest rate component” (that has impacts on CET1 ratio) of the asset or liability at FVO we are interested in knowing if this component has to be taken into account in order to calculate the part of the Assets/Liabilities that is going to be considered for the thresholds calculation?  4. Does the answer to question 3 changes if the interest rate component is hedged “back to back” (reference to Q\u0026A n. 29) with external counterparties or only hedged with a “portfolio approach”? Moreover, it is correct to consider as “not back to back hedges” (then a situation in which still the interest rate movements determine some P\u0026L and consequently CET 1 effects) the situation in which there is a hedge back to back with a subsidiary that manages the interest rate risk with “portfolio approach”?  5. Which is the meaning of “exactly matching, offsetting positions (art. 105 (14) point 3” to be excluded in the calculation of Simplified Approach threshold? Does it mean only an asset position and the corresponding position took as a liability, that exactly match each other in term of security type and amount (e.g. € 1 mln long position in Google equity stock in the trading book portfolio and 1 € mln short position on Google stock) or the meaning refers also to perfect hedging strategy (e.g. long the stock, short the equity futures with delta =0)?"}

Broadly speaking, the institution only 'passes through' the collateral, i.e. it receives collateral from the client and passes it on to the CCP. In the case of deterioration of the collateral value, whereas the institution indeed faces a collateral call from the central counterparty, it is simultaneously entitled to demand additional collateral (usually of at least equal amount) from the client, hence preventing a net outflow from the perspective of the institution.

According to Article 357(3) for the purpose of Article 360(1), the excess of an institution’s long positions over its short positions, or vice versa, in the same commodity and identical commodity futures, options and warrants shall be its net position in each commodity. However, gross position is not explicitly defined. With regard to the abovementioned provisions, it is not clear whether long and short positions in the same commodity (or the same derivative based on the commodity) should be netted against each other in the first place and then the net and gross positions should be calculated taking into account positions in derivatives with the same commodity as the underlying instrument, or all positions in the commodity (spot and derivatives) should be accounted for separately. To clarify the problem, let’s consider the following example: Positions in the trading book based on the same commodity: A. Long CFD = 10 B. Short CFD = -5 C. Long Futures 3 month = 3 D.

Pursuant to Article 360(1)(a), for net positions (\"long or short\") positions in the same commodity, or commodity derivative contracts (futures, options, forwards, warrants, etc.) are netted in order to calculate the net position in that particular contract.

However, the C 09.04 template itself does not have any dimensions to distinguish “relevant credit exposures” from all the exposures reported on C 07.00 and therefore requires that this value be populated for all exposures classes including points (a) to (f) of Article 112 of the CRR. Both the C.09.04 and C.07.00 use the same “type of risk” dimension – “Credit risk, counterparty credit risk and free deliveries”; and the same “main category” – “Instruments subject to credit risk excluding instruments subject to securitisation credit risk treatment”. Only the country specific sheets for C 09.04 use an additional dimension/ attribute for “Residence of Immediate Obligor” – which distinguishes them slightly from the C 07.00 templates but still does not contain a specific dimension to require only “relevant credit exposures”.  As a result the correct exposure value for only relevant credit exposures cannot be populated on this return as the XBRL submission fails if the values do not agree between the C 07.00 and the C 09.04.

This is incorrect with regard to the following two aspects:   Differences in scope of exposures: template C 09.04 captures relevant exposures according to Article 140 (4) of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD), and not exposures subject to own funds requirements in accordance with Part Three, Title II, chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR).

The DPM of template C 09.04 will be amended as soon as possible to remedy these issues.

Template 040.00, column 010 refers explicitly to an Accounting balance sheet value.

This would then be inconsistent with Template C40.00, columns 040 and 050 where an add-on should be reported, which can only be based on risk positions. The sum of the risk positions of a looked through investment does not always constitute the accounting balance sheet value. Example: if a mutual fund places a deposit with the reporting institution, the look through approach with eliminate this transaction, since it is then an internal deal. Therefor the sum of Risk positions usually can be defined as Accounting Value minus internal deals. It is not clear how that should be implemented in the reporting.

Row 090 of template F 05.00 requires information by counterparty on loans collateralized by immovable property. Template F 13.01 of FINREP contains a breakdown of loans collateralized by immovable property which only considers two possible values: residential and commercial (columns 010 and 020). We are not sure whether we must also understand that in template F 05.00 only residential and commercial immovable property is to be considered. Annex V of the ITS on supervisory reporting does not clarify the issue. In the instructions to template F 13.01 (paragraph 81 of Part 2) it is said that 1cFor reporting loans and advances according to the type of pledge the following definitions shall be used: (a) within 1cMortgage loans [Loans collateralised by immovable property] 1d, 1cResidential 1d includes loans secured by residential immovable property and 1cCommercial 1d loans secured by pledges of commercial immovable property; in both cases as defined in the CRR.

This would suggest that the spirit of the of asset encumbrance reporting is that only the O/C required to meet regulatory requirements is encumbered for Covered Bonds, where the Covered Bond is either issued to external holders or repo’d to third parties. The key here is what constitutes “freely available”. If “freely available” and “freely withdrawable” mean the same thing then one refers to pages 4 and 5 of the ITS attaching to Asset Encumbrance Reporting. The “Credit Enhance and “approval before withdrawal” interpretation is critical. Before allowing assets to be removed from the pool the Covered Asset Monitor (CAM) performs a number of checks. Once the checks are satisfied, the assets can be removed from the Covered Pool. The CAM does not necessarily take in to account rating agency over-collateralisation requirements (unless contractually/legally committed as part of an issuance) in conducting these checks and has no reason not to approve asset removal once these tests are passed. Does the fact that the Assets can be removed once some known checks on the pool are performed mean they are “freely available”? Alternatively, given that the CAM must perform these checks before allowing the assets to be removed mean that CAM approval is required, in which case the “Freely Withdrawable” test is failed. There are further references in the EBA REPORT ON EU COVERED BOND FRAMEWORKS AND CAPITAL TREATMENT issued on July 1st 2014 that suggest the spirit of encumbrance reporting in respect of Covered Bonds is that O/C in cover pools that is not necessary to fulfil regulatory requirements would not be deemed to be encumbered. For example on pages 58 and 59 in the “EBA recommendations on coverage principle and over-collateralisation” legal/regulatory as well as voluntary O/C for targeting a specific rating are discussed in the context of the nature of the commitment to maintain over-collateralisation impacting on the likelihood that the assets constituting the over-collateralisation are kept in the cover pool as scenarios of distress arise, such as the issuer’s default or resolution, approach. The paragraph is as follows: \"Over-collateralisation can be maintained on a voluntary basis, as the result of some form of contractual commitment, as a condition to target specific credit ratings and/or due to a legal/regulatory requirement. The different nature of the commitment to maintain over-collateralisation impacts on the likelihood that the assets constituting the over-collateralisation are kept in the cover pool as scenarios of distress arise, such as the issuer’s default or resolution, approach. Those are the circumstances in which the over-collateralisation commitment for the interest of the covered bond investors is more likely to be reduced in favour of interests of a different nature.\" ","Permanent link":"link (http://www.eba.europa.eu/single-rule-book-qa/-/qna/view/publicId/2015_1817)","Subparagraph":"","Question ID":"2015_1817","identifier":"2015_1817","Published as Final Q\u0026A":{"$date":"2015-09-25T00:00:00.000Z"},"COM Delegated or Implementing Acts/EBA RTS/EBA ITS/EBA GLs":"Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 - ITS on supervisory reporting of institutions (as amended) ","Date of submission":{"$date":"2015-02-11T00:00:00.000Z"},"Paragraph":"","Subject matter ":"Asset Encumbrance \u0026 Covered Bonds","EBA answer":" In accordance with the General  Instructions of Annex III IV of the ITS on asset encumbrance reporting under Article 100 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, it is outlined that, for the purpose of Annex XVII IV and Annex XVI of Regulation 680/2014 on Supervisory Reporting of institutions, an asset shall be treated as encumbered if it has been pledged or if it is subject to any form of arrangement to secure, collateralise or credit enhance any transaction from which it cannot be freely withdrawn.

One institution implemented the default definition in retail as follows:  1. In the case of Retail Small Business (SME) segment the implementation is clear: clients are different from other retail clients and the default flag is attached only within this group, at the level of a client. It means that if one exposure of the client defaults, the whole client is treated as defaulted and all exposures of the bank to such a client have a default status (this approach is considered as default at the client level within this segment/product group).  2. The rest of retail portfolio – Retail non SME is divided into two main categories:  a. Retail unsecured (this segment is under STD by now) – all unsecured loans If a client has e.g. 3 credit cards and 2 consumer loans and default occurred at any of these exposures/loans, such a client is considered as defaulted and in the RWA calculation all 5 exposures are treated as defaulted (i.e. the information of the default status is transferred within these groups of product). The above mentioned default status is not transferred to the exposures in the segment “Retail mortgage” in the case of particular client. However, the opposite transfer is possible. If the default occurred in the exposure in the “Retail mortgage” segment, the client is treated as defaulted also in the segment “Retail unsecured”. This approach to the default definition is called by the bank “client level approach”.  b. Retail – mortgages (IRB approach) –all loans secured by a mortgage (residential/commercial) If a client has e.g. 3 mortgage loans and default occurred at any of these exposures, only the particular exposure is considered as defaulted (PD=1 in RWA calculation), the other two exposures are treated as not defaulted (PD different from 1). In this segment (mortgage loans) the information about the default is not transferred to other mortgage loans and neither to the “Retail unsecured” segment. Although there is no definition of individual credit facility in the CRR, this approach to the default definition is called by the bank “facility level approach”. As a consequence the same parameter can lead to status \"default\" and \"non-default\".

Except from being a retail exposure, the CRR specifies no further conditions. In particular, there are no additional restrictions to the information which an institution may take into account for identifying whether it considers that an obligor is unlikely to pay the credit obligations related to the individual credit facility as specified by Article 178(1)(a) CRR, i.e. the default may be considered to extend to other credit facilities through adequate specification of additional indications of unlikeliness to pay for these specific types of retail facilities. However, where the definition of default is applied at the obligor level, default is recognised on all exposures of an obligor at the same time.  As a consequence, for applying the definition of default at the level of a specific individual credit facility for the Retail portfolio, institutions may in particular consider default events on other individual credit facilities for the same obligor as relevant information if this provides for a meaningful assessment of obligor and transaction characteristics. In the case of the IRB Approach institutions should also specify the indications of unlikeliness to pay in such a way that:  (1) they ensure a meaningful differentiation of risk and accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk as required by Article 144(1)(a) CRR; and  (2) the internal rating of the specific credit facility, in particular the classification of exposures as defaulted, plays an essential role in the processes required by Article 144(1)(b) CRR.

However, instruments eligible as own funds under the grandfathering provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 are not subject to the requirements that apply to capital instruments that are fully eligible in their own right. Therefore grandfathered instruments may include clauses in their terms and conditions according to which the distribution on the instrument would be cancelled if the institution does not make a distribution on another capital instrument without that clause being regarded as interfering with the flexibility of payments required for the fully eligible instrument.     The treatment set out in the answer to question 1 applies to capital instruments with or without step-ups.  The interpretation cannot be confirmed for the reasons given in the answer to question 1. ","Article":"52","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":"In question 2013_15 the EBA clarified that legacy step-up Tier 1 instruments with quarterly calls will not be eligible as fully CRR compliant Tier 2 instruments after their first call and step-up date. In question 2013_31 the EBA clarified that non-step-up Tier 1 instruments could be eligible, for the amounts exceeding the grandfathering limits, as fully eligible Tier 2 instruments with no time limit and independently of the frequency of calls, with an important caveat : should the terms of the legacy non-step-up Tier 1 instruments interfere with Articles 28(1)(h)(vii)) (CET1) and 52(1)(l)(v) (AT1), then such AT1 and CET1 instruments could be disqualified, while the legacy non-step-up Tier 1 instrument would remain in fully eligible Tier 2. By doing so the EBA referenced to questions 2013_21 and 2013_54. However, these two questions mainly dealt with \"stopper provisions\" and more precisely about cases where the legacy non-step-up Tier 1 instruments have terms that could prevent (optionally or in a mandatory way) coupons being paid if distributions are skipped on CET1 or AT1 instruments. I have several questions related to this : 1. My first question is to confirm that the same reasoning would apply during the grandfathering period independently of the fact that the bonds would still be within the grandfathering limit or not. Logically the answer should be yes as questions 2013_21 and 2013_54 clarify that the impact of the terms of the legacy instrument is not on the regulatory eligibility of this instrument but on the AT1 / CET1 instruments. The effect of the terms of the grandfathered bonds on the CET1 / AT1 bonds is obviously totally independent of the grandfathering status of the grandfathered bond (with the possible exception of contractual provisions that make an explicit reference to pushers / stoppers only on bonds that are included in regulatory capital.) 2. My second question is to confirm that the same reasoning would apply to step-up bonds as I see no reason why the impact of pusher / stopper provisions on CET1 / AT1 bonds would be different if there is a step up or not and application of articles 28(1)(h)(vii)) (CET1) and 52(1)(l)(v) (AT1) would be the same for step / non step bonds. 3. My third question is on pusher provisions. Many legacy Tier 1 instruments have pusher provisions saying that a coupon being paid on the legacy Tier 1 instrument forces a payment on \"pari passu\" bonds, such pari passu bonds being defined in the contract. Could the EBA confirm that, if an additional Tier 1 is included in the list of pari passu bonds defined in the legacy Tier 1 contract, then the AT1 instrument would not be eligible? This is because of the fact that [not paying on AT1 implies not paying on Legacy Tier 1] is logically strictly the same as [paying on Legacy Tier 1 implies paying on AT1], so in such cases not paying coupons on the AT1 would obviously trigger restrictions for the bank, the case specifically considered by the EBA in question 2013_21."}

That number is broken down into pay bands. Conversely, the provision does not per se require disclosing the identity of individual persons receiving certain remuneration or pertaining to a certain pay band.  Only in exceptional circumstances it may be possible to identify an individual \"high earner\" from the number of individuals being remunerated over specified levels. In such a case the disclosure of information required by Article 450(1)(i) of the CRR amounts to the disclosure of personal data within the meaning of Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and of Article 2(a) of Directive 95/46/EC on protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.  Regarding the latter instrument, it should be stated from the outset that the fact that pursuant to Article 450(2) CRR institutions must comply with the requirements of Article 450 \"without prejudice to Directive 95/46/EC\" does not mean that the disclosure of information required under Article 450(1)(i) of the CRR is precluded where it amounts to the processing of personal data.  As regards Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, it is recalled that under Article 52(1) of the Charter the interference with a fundamental right is only lawful if:   it is provided for by law;   it respects the essence of the fundamental right at stake;  the interference must pursue an objective of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others; and  in line with principle of proportionality, any such interference must be appropriate in light of objectives pursued  and not go beyond what is necessary.   In the present context the following elements should be considered:   the disclosure requirement in question is laid down in a directly applicable provision of Union law;  the disclosure requirements are easily foreseeable for the staff members concerned;  as results from Recital 97 of the CRR, the disclosure requirement of Article 450(1)(i) serves the legitimate objective of general interest of contributing to sound remuneration policies, which are in turn important for the soundness and stability of financial institutions. Poorly designed remuneration policies have the capacity to increase to an unacceptable extent the risks for financial institutions. Furthermore, high earners have normally an important role to play in directing the business and in the long term performance of the same institutions. Therefore, transparency on their pay brackets allows stakeholders and citizens alike to regain trust in the financial institutions;  Under Article 450(1)(i) of the CRR, the information to be disclosed is strictly limited to pay bands, without further details such as the precise amount of the remunerations or its different components.   Therefore, to the extent that exceptionally the disclosure of information required under Article 450(1)(i) CRR amounts to the disclosure of \"personal data\" such interference with the fundamental right protected by Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is lawful.

The European Authorities agree that EC legislation on The right of establishment and on the freedom to provide services Directive 2013/36/EC (formerly Directive 2006/48/EC) neither defines nor contains any provisions as regards agents and subagents of credit institutions. Due to this circumstance the FMA and other European Authorities have different opinions in this matter. In the opinion of other European Authorities, credit institutions within the meaning of Article 3, subsection 1, para 1 of Directive 2013/36/EC (formerly Article 4, subsection 1 of Directive 2006/48/EC) can exercise the right of establishment and the freedom to provide services in another Member state only in accordance with Articles 35 et seq of Directive 2013/36/EC (formerly Article 25 et seq of Directive 2006/48/EC). Payment institutions, on the other hand, can exercise the right of establishment and the freedom to provide services in another Member State in accordance with Article 25 of Directive 2007/64/EC. The European Authorities support the view that agents of credit institutions could be treated similarly only to agents as defined in Article 4, subsection 22 of Directive 2007/64/EC. The understanding of those European Authorities is that Directive 2007/64/EC is the latest and the most comprehensive European legal act governing the provision of payment services and money remittance services in particular within the European Community, and it applies to credit institutions also by virtue of their qualification as payment service providers in Article 1, subsection a of Directive 2007/64/EC and, point 4 of Annex I of Directive 2013/36/EC (formerly point 4 of Annex I of Directive 2006/48/EC) as amended with Article 92 of the Directive 2007/64/EC, which also refers to „payment services” as defined in Article 4, subsection 3 of Directive 2007/64/EC. The European Authorities brought to the attention of the FMA that Directive 2007/64/EC and its corresponding national legal acts do not provide for the use of subagents to carry out money remittance business. Therefore, in order to ensure legality of agent/subagents business and its compliance with the relevant EU legal framework, which requires a notification from the competent authorities of a Home Member State to the competent authorities of a Host Member State, all agents/subagents acting on the territory of a Host Member State need to be notified or confirmed by the authority of the Home Member State to the authority of the Host Member State.

In the absence of provisions in the EU legislative texts, the decisions of whether and how to authorise and regulate agents and subagents are left to the discretion of Member States.  This discretion is however limited; the provision of services by agents should still be possible under the general framework established by the EU Treaties; a control by the host Member State is possible insofar as it complies with certain requirements (such as general interest and proportionality). When (if) limiting the free provision of services for agents mandated by credit institutions established in another Member State, the host Member State shall take into account what has already been done in terms of control by the home Member State.  In any case, a Member State cannot use Articles 17 and 25 of Directive 2007/64/EC as a legal basis to require the application of the procedures set out in these articles to agents acting on behalf of a credit institution:   Articles 17 and 25 of Directive 2007/64/EC clearly specify that the provisions of these articles only apply to payment institutions and not to credit institutions; otherwise, both articles would have referred to \"payment service providers\" instead of \"payment institutions\"; \"payment service providers\" is the general term referring to all financial entities which are allowed to carry out payment services, including credit and payment institutions; Article 1 of Directive 2007/64/EC also makes a clear distinction between \"credit institutions\" and \"payment institutions\". As other provisions also distinguish between payment institutions and credit institutions, there is no reason to consider that the same treatment should necessarily apply to all agents irrespective of whether or not these agents act on behalf of a credit institution or a payment institution on the grounds that this would ensure equal treatment between credit institutions and payment institutions. In a similar way, a Member State cannot use Articles 35 and seq. of Directive 2013/36/EU as a legal basis to require the application of the  procedures set out in these articles to agents acting on behalf of a credit institution;    Articles 35 and seq. of Directive 2013/36/EU only specify the notification requirements for the establishment of a branch in another Member State without referring to any agent; these articles cannot be interpreted so that agents would be automatically included in the scope of application of these requirements;  It is not because Directive 2007/64/EC provides for the same treatment for both agents and branches in its articles 17 and 25 that agents acting on behalf of a credit institution should be treated as branches; an agent is different from a branch, given that the former is a separate natural or legal person from the credit institution although acting on behalf of this credit institution; a branch is not a separate legal entity and forms a dependent part of the credit institution; another difference between these two types of banking offices is that branches may accept deposits, while agents cannot.

The important point is that the total reported should cover all items referred to in Titles II and III and their components regardless of the currency of an individual item. The reporting of items denominated in the reporting currency under Article 415(1) plus items denominated in a currency different to the reporting currency subject to reporting under Article 415(2) plus items denominated in a currency different to the reporting currency not subject to reporting under Article 415(2) provides for the reporting of all items regardless of the currency of an individual item.  (ii) Article 415(2) provides for the reporting of items denominated in a currency different from the reporting currency under Article 415(1). Article 415(2) therefore does not provide for the reporting of items denominated in the reporting currency under Article 415(1). From a prudential perspective it can be important to require the separate reporting of items denominated in the reporting currency since such items can often be significant for liquidity purposes. Indeed Article 4(5) of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 requires credit institutions to calculate and monitor their liquidity coverage ratio separately for liabilities in the reporting currency.

I would like to confirm with you that a credit institution may be allowed to exclude exposures from large exposure calculations which are fully covered by own funds and that those funds are not used for any purposes other than this.

To avoid this, we seek clarification with respect to the treatment of inflows from credit facilities in the LCR.  According to Article 32 in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 an inflow from credit facilities may arise if:  1. A credit facility becomes due, cf. Article 32; and 2.There is a contractual payment of interests related to the facility, cf. Article 32. Question 1: In the case at hand, the legal contracts behind credit facilities between a credit institution and a banking customer state that customers are obliged to repay their debt in connection to a credit facility to the credit institution at contractually set dates. This can be an expiry date for the facility or a renegotiation date. However, it is common practice to prolong credit facilities for a longer period in time, if customers wish to do so. Furthermore, it might not be reasonable to expect that the costumer can pay their debt at these dates. This implies that despite contractually set dates at which the facilities become due, there is no repayment of debt from most facilities to credit institutions. However, some credit institutions report inflows from prolonged credit facilities even though there is no actual debt repayment. Furthermore, some facilities both have a contractual date of termination and a “renegotiation date” at which the terms of the facility are renegotiable. That is, we have identified the following reporting practices: - Case A: Some institutions estimate inflows based on contractual termination dates and report an inflow even if the contract is expected to be prolonged. - Case B: Some institutions also include estimated inflows based on contractual “renegotiation dates” and report an inflow on these even if the contract is expected to be prolonged. - Case C: Some institutions estimate inflows based on actual expected repayments (in cash) of debt from credit facilities. If credit facilities are expected to be prolonged when they become due (case A and B above), should institutions report an inflow? Should institutions only report inflows from credit facilities if they expect there to be debt repayments in cash (case C above)?   Question 2: The legal contracts behind credit facilities between a credit institution and a banking customer can state that customers are obliged to pay interest to the credit institution, which would imply inflows in the LCR. Interest payments in cash will give rise to inflows in the LCR, cf. Article 32 LCR DA. If interest payments take another form, would it also give rise to inflows in the LCR? For instance, could institutions report inflows from interest payments on facilities, which take place by increasing the total drawn amount on the credit facility, e.g. there is no interest payment in cash to the credit institution?

Institutions shall substitute total assets of the consolidated group for total annual sales when total annual sales are not a meaningful indicator of firm size and total assets are a more meaningful indicator than total annual sales.

Indeed, GFST are to be used as a last resort only after assessing the use of other resolution tools (Article 56(2) BRRD).  The bridge bank tool laid out in Article 40 of Directive 2014/59/EU (BRRD) would typically be used if a private sector purchaser is not immediately available to purchase the critical functions of the institution under resolution. Furthermore, whilst the use of a bridge bank is typical in a situation of a close bank bail-in, TPO would be more useful in situations of open bank bail-in. In any event, also for the use of TPOs, there must be prior loss absorption by shareholders and creditors of 8% of total liabilities including own funds as set out in Article 37(9).  Furthermore, GSTs, such as TPO, would only be available in very extraordinary situations of a systemic crisis.

This means that for each of the categories “high risk” / “medium risk” / “medium/low risk” / “low risk” in paragraph 10 of Article 166 CRR, some of the off-balance assigned to the respective category by Annex I CRR do not fall under “other credit lines”. Since in particular the following items are not explicitly mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 8 of Article 166 CRR, this raises the question whether they are covered by the term “other credit lines”:  (1) guarantees having the character of credit substitutes, (e.g. guarantees for the good payment of credit facilities);  (2) long-term letters of credit arising from the movement of goods. Q\u0026A 2014_1263 has clarified that an institution's own estimates of conversion factors can only be used for the items listed in Article 166(8) of the CRR. This restriction might be explained by the issue that own estimates for such off-balance sheet items for which drawings additionally depend on a certain specified event, would require additionally modelling the likeliness of these events rather than solely the additionally drawn amount that would be outstanding at default. This could cause the following issues:  (a) Where such events are not credit events, this could require modelling of non-credit-risk events.  (b) Where such events are credit events, this could result in unjustified double recognition of the likeliness of defaults and losses. The likeliness of a default of the obligor of the guaranteed exposure and the percentage ultimately drawn on the guarantee is already reflected by PD and LGD. Thus, this cannot be again reflected by reducing the exposure value by a conversion factor less than 100%, which explains why in particular guarantees having the character of credit substitutes are assigned by Annex I CRR to the “high risk” category for which a conversion factor of 100% applies, according to Article 166(10) CRR.

It may happen, that the measurement - and related accounting treatment - of the transaction is different in each counterparty´s books (e.g. bond measured in amortized cost in the issuer´s statement of financial position \"SOFP\" versus the fair value measurement in the buyer´s SOFP).   In such case, two differing amounts resulting from the same transactions need to be treated in line with the requirement of the Delegated Act.   Example  Bank A has booked a liability of EUR 100 and an asset of EUR 40 both resulting from intragroup transactions eligible for deduction (for simplification there are only two parties to the contract). Then the Bank A reduces (evenly) its contribution base by EUR 50 (liability) and EUR 20 (asset), in total EUR 70, no matter how these transactions are booked by the counterparty.  Example Extension  If the Bank´s A liability of EUR 100 was a (issued) bond measured in amortized cost, bought by Bank B (e.g. parent) which measures the bond in the fair value of EUR 110, the Bank B reduces the contribution base by EUR 55.

Article 94 of Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements for variable elements of remuneration. Article 94 (1)(g)(i) establishes that \"the variable component shall not exceed 100% of the fixed component…\", Article 94(1)(l) establishes that \"a substantial portion, and in any case 50% of any variable remuneration shall consist of a balance of\" non-cash instruments.   The remuneration of staff consists of a variable and a fixed component and the ratio between them is calculated – taking into account, where implemented, Article 94(1)(g)(iii) that allows that a \"maximum of 25% of total variable remuneration\" is discounted. Paragraph 4 of the EBA Guidelines on the applicable notional discount rate for variable remuneration specifies that : \"For the purpose of these guidelines the discount rate is the value by which a nominal amount of awarded variable remuneration which vests in the future is multiplied in order to obtain its discounted value. The discounted value is then used for the calculation of the ratio between the fixed and the variable components of total remuneration for identified staff\".  According to the Guidelines on sound remuneration policies (section 14, par 227) the institution determines the awards of variable remuneration based on assessed performance and risks and applies ex ante risk adjustments. Only afterwards the variable remuneration is paid (section 15, 233) partly in cash, partly in non-cash instruments.  The calculation of the ratio has to be made based on the nominal amount of remuneration awarded, only afterwards the number of instruments that staff should receive as part of their variable remuneration should be established based on their value.  To this end the instruments referred to in Article 94(1)(l) have to be valued. The instruments referred to are the share, equivalent ownership interest, share linked or equivalent non-cash instruments or other instruments as defined within the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 527/2014 of 12 March 2014 supplementing Directive (EU) No 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the classes of instruments that adequately reflect the credit quality of an institution as a going concern and are appropriate to be used for the purposes of variable remuneration (RTS on instruments).  Where available, institutions should use the market price; where this is not available the fair value. Using the fair value instead of the market price, where available, would be considered as a circumvention of the remuneration requirements. (see also par 164 f of the Guidelines on sound remuneration policies).  In particular par 252 of the Guidelines on sound remuneration policies specifies that: \"Share-linked or other equivalent non-cash instruments (e.g. stock appreciation rights, types of synthetic shares) are those instruments or contractual obligations, including instruments based on cash, whose value is based on the market price or, where a market price is not available, the fair value of the stock or equivalent ownership right and track the market price or fair value. All such instruments should have the same effect in terms of loss absorbency as shares or equivalent ownership interests.\" \"Instruments should be priced at the market price or their fair value on the date of the award of these instruments\" (par 256 of the Guidelines. This means that the valuation should establish the market value (where available) or the fair value of the instrument, in the meaning of Article 94(1)(l),  at the date of the award.  Paragraph 12 of IFRS 2 states “the entity shall measure the fair value of the employee services received by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.” Paragraphs 16 and 17 define how this fair value should be calculated and state that “an entity shall measure the fair value of equity instruments granted at the measurement date (defined in IFRS 2 as ‘the date at which the fair value of the equity instruments granted is measured for the purposes of this IFRS. For transactions with employees and others providing similar services the measurement date is the grant date), based on market prices if available” and that “if market prices are not available, the entity shall estimate the fair value of the equity instruments granted.” Hence, these paragraphs of IFRS 2 match with the valuation methodology included in paragraphs 252 and 256 of the EBA Guidelines. Both sets of rules are not contradictory but rather suggest the same use of measurement techniques and therefore the accounting valuation as prescribed in IFRS 2 is acceptable under the CRD IV and EBA Guidelines on sound remuneration policies.  Par 188 of the Guidelines on sound remuneration policies specifies that ‘the ratio between variable and fixed remuneration components should be set independent of any potential future ex post risk adjustment or fluctuation in the price of instruments. The valuation of the instrument must not take into account that eventually the variable remuneration awarded in such instruments is subject to malus or clawback or that such deferred variable remuneration might be reduced in case staff leaves. Such aspects are not relevant for the value of the instrument as such.  Par 125 of the Guidelines on sound remuneration policies only applies to variable remuneration that is based on future performance and establishes that the valuation of a fixed number of instruments awarded should exceptionally be valued for the purpose of calculating the ratio between the variable and fixed component of total remuneration at the market price or fair value when the prospective remuneration plan was granted. The feedback table to the Guidelines explains (regarding par 120 of the consultation paper) that this valuation was implemented to \"ensure that institutions can determine ex ante\" – at grant, before the actual award is made – \"the maximum ratio between the variable and the fixed remuneration for identified staff.\" Also here the general rule applies that listed institutions use the market price and non-listed institutions the fair value of the instrument.","Article":"Article 94 CRD IV","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":" Is it possible to value Long Term Instruments, included in the variable component, according to the IFRS 2 as accounting standard?

Die Berücksichtigung von Abschreibungen in dieser Spalte wäre nicht sinnvoll.

Angesichts der unterschiedlichen Ziele, die mit diesen beiden Vorlagen verfolgt werden, ist auf kurzfristige Sicht keine Änderung vorgesehen.  English Answer:  The column c020 of F04.04 template does not include \"write-offs\" since its goal is not to assess the allowances in financial assets, but to present a detailed breakdown of financial instruments. Including information for \"write-offs\" in this column would not make sense. Furthermore, F07.00 template, which looks closely at allowances and impairment in financial assets, is not so much interested in the composition of each portfolio but devotes its attention to the different allowances recognised by the entity. In this context, information about write-offs becomes highly relevant.  Therefore, given the different goals of these two templates, it is not envisaged to amend them in the short-term.","Article":"99","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":"German Question (Deutsche Frage): Tabelle F 07.00 Spalte 080 sollte allein schon aufgrund der Benennung und der angegebenen Referenzen abstimmbar sein zu Tabelle F 04.04 Spalte 030.

Eine solche Spalte gibt es in Tabelle F 04.04 jedoch nicht. Es könnte daher argumentiert werden, dass in Tabelle F 04.04 Spalte 030 der Bestand der Einzelwertberichtigungen um diesen Verbrauch zu erhöhen wäre (dann wäre aber keine Abstimmbarkeit zu Tabelle F 07.00 Spalte 080 oder zu der entsprechenden IFRS-Abschluss-Position mehr möglich) oder dass in Tabelle F 04.04 Spalte 020 der gross carrying amount für abgeschriebene Forderungen den Betrag nach Direktabschreibungen darstellt (dann wäre die Bezeichnung gross carrying amount aber inhaltlich fragwürdig.

Ferner wären für Tabelle F 04.04 die entsprechenden über die Spalten summierenden validation rules anzupassen. English Question: Table F 07.00 column 080 should be reconciled from its name alone, and the references given therein, to table F 04.04 column 030. However, the problem here lies in the fact that in table F 07.00, there is another column 110, in which would be shown, for example, expenditure of specific allowances for debts not yet disposed of. However, no such column exists in table F 04.04. It could thus be argued that in table F 04.04 column 030, the amount for specific allowances should be increased by this expenditure (although reconciliation to table F 07.00 column 080 or to the corresponding IFRS final position would then no longer be possible), or that in table F 04.04 column 020, the gross carrying amount for written-off receivables represents the amount after direct write-offs (although this would then make the accuracy of the term gross carrying amount questionable). Because of this problem of consistency, it should be suggested to the EBA that a column 060 ‘Accumulated write-offs’ be added to table F 04.04, and that the column which was previously 060 in table F 04.04 become column 070. Furthermore, for table F 04.04, the corresponding validation rules for totalling up the columns would need to be adjusted."}

Those articles explicitly mention reciprocal cross holdings, holdings of own funds instruments of financial sector entities where the institution has a significant investment and holdings of own funds instruments of financial sector entities where the institution does not have a significant investment as separate deductions. The reporting in C 01.00 follows the structure of the CRR. The structure of C 05.01 is closely linked to the structure of C 01.00. As a consequence, the C 05.01 also has a separate reporting of holdings included in the question above. Hence there is an unambiguous assignment for those holdings to the block of rows 240 to 330, 340 to 370 or 390 to 420 of C 05.01.  When calculating the residual amounts for reciprocal cross holdings, the CRR refers to the respective treatment of holdings of own funds instruments of financial sector entities where the institution has/does not have a significant investment. Due to the fact that the calculation of the residual amount (to be reported in column 060) is different depending on whether there is a significant holding or not (see articles 472 (9) and (10) CRR), the C 05.01 asks for a separate reporting for those cases. The amount to be reported in column 060 is the basis amount (respectively the residual amount) relevant to calculate the adjustments. Due to the fact that the CRR includes cross references for the reciprocal cross holdings, the approach for calculating the amounts for columns 060 of rows 260, 290, 320 and 340 to 370 is the same (the same is true for column 060 and rows 270, 300, 330 and 390 to 420 respectively).   ","Article":"Article 99","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":"(CA5;240 to 330;*) cover Reciprocal Cross Holdings.

These types of institutions should be situated within the same Member State (by virtue of Articles 10 and 113(7) of Regulation No 575/2013 CRR)).

Chapter 4, Title IV of Part Three of the CRR does not mention a specific treatment for commodity-indices or commodity-index futures comparable to the stock-index future treatment specified in Article 344 of the CRR that would allow an institution to treat commodity-indices or commodity-index futures as if they were individual commodities.

The payment of such a bonus is therefore not necessarily linked to the staff member´s performance and/or results of the institution, but the fact that the staff member is still employed by the institution for a pre-defined time period.  The principle in Article 94(1)(e) of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD)(replacing Annex V, Section 11, point 23 (j) of Directive 2006/48/EC (CRD III)) referenced in the question notes that:  \"guaranteed variable remuneration is exceptional, occurs only when hiring new staff and where the institution has a sound and strong capital base and is limited to the first year of employment;\". In the CEBS Guidelines on Remuneration, paragraph 69, it is clarified that:  \"Guaranteed variable remuneration can take several forms such as a \"guaranteed bonus\", \"welcome bonus\", \"sign-on bonus\", \"minimum bonus\", etc. and can be granted either in cash or in instruments...\".  In the CEBS Guidelines on Remuneration, paragraph 12, it is stated that  \"A \"retention bonus\" is a form of variable remuneration and can only be allowed to the extent that risk alignment requirements are properly applied\".  Consequently, retention bonuses (as a form of variable remuneration), where paid to staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the institution's risk profile (identified staff), have to respect all the criteria applicable to variable remuneration under CRD (payment in instruments, deferral, retention, malus, claw back etc.). Failing this, such retention bonuses would not be admissible under Article 94(1) of CRD.  Application of the criteria for variable remuneration, especially maluses and claw back, would mean in practice that the 'retention bonus' would be paid or vested in full \"only if it is sustainable according to the financial situation of the institution as a whole, and justified according to the performance of the institution, the business unit and the individual concerned\" (c.f. Article 94(1)(n) of CRD.  Further, a retention bonus is only awarded on the condition that the staff member stays in the contract for the given time period, which is also a reason for not considering a retention bonus as guaranteed.  In conclusion, under the provisions of Article 94 (1) of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD), retention bonuses are only admissible as long as they are treated as variable remuneration, as provided in paragraph 12 in the CEBS Remuneration Guidelines, meaning that all criteria applicable to variable remuneration under CRD are applied.  Any form of variable remuneration should always be in line with sound and effective risk management and the institution's remuneration policy, and therefore institutions should be able to substantiate their legitimate interest in awarding retention bonuses. For example, retention bonuses could be used under restructurings, in wind down or after a change of control, but also in other situations where the institution can provide a rationale for its legitimate interest in retaining a relevant staff member.  However, retention bonuses would not be in accordance with remuneration principles, and therefore inadmissible, if they were awarded to merely compensate for bonuses not paid due to insufficient performance or the institution's (negative) financial situation, in a business-as-usual scenario, or in other non-legitimate situations.","Article":"94","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":"Is a “retention bonus”, i.e. a bonus solely granted for staying with a credit institution for a pre-defined time, still admissible in the light of remuneration principle Article 94(1)(e) of Directive 2013/36/EU (replacing Annex V, Section 11, point 23 (j) of Directive 2006/48/EC (CRDIII))?"}

However a much common way to reduce the derivative exposure is to have the cash equity or bond as part of a portfolio that combines cash instruments (already settled) with derivatives with the condition that both cash instruments and derivatives are part of a portfolio within a QCCP. This means that an account holder in a CCP with a long equity or bond position fully pledged to the QCCP can be offset with a short position of equivalent derivative instrument.  The example would be a bank member or with an individual segregated client in the QCCP with a long 100 shares fully pledged to the CCP and short a futures contract in the same underlying, HAS NO LEVERAGE AT ALL AS BOTH LEGS OF THE POSITION ARE UNCONDITIONALLY TIED UP TO THE CCP. For this reason preventing cash instruments fully pledged to the QCCP to be diminishing derivatives exposures has no reason behind the final goal of limiting derivatives exposure with the leverage ratio. It would be quite illogical that for the purpose of calculating leverage ratio it is allowed a exposure reduction on a combined position of long futures and short synthetic (short call and long put) and not allowing the reduction with a position of long cash instrument and short synthetic.

Usually, entities like government departments, ministries and other governmental authorities altogether constitute the central government and do not take up loans in their own name. In this case, they should be regarded as one single entity and the exposure be reported in one sum under the name of the central government. However, if there are entities in the form of separate legal persons that, for example, fulfil public tasks by order of the central government , but can take up their own loans, they are to be considered as distinct borrowers (i.e. Public Sector Entities). If, in the latter case, the entity is controlled by / interconnected with the central government, the two of them would constitute a group of connected clients.  As concerns the assessment of groups of connected clients, Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) provides a choice to the institutions. As an illustration, assume that the central government A (as defined above) directly controls entity B and B controls B1 and B2. In addition, A also directly controls company C, which again controls C1 and C2 and C2 controls C2.1 and C2.2. In the case of central governments, not all these entities have to be regarded as one single group of connected clients. Instead, according to Article 4(1)(39) of the CRR, the institution may assess and report the risks separately, meaning that A, B, B1 and B2 form one group of connected clients and that A, C, C1, C2, C2.1 and C2.2 form another group of connected clients.","Article":"4","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":"As large exposure reporting is based on a client data – how should an institution report exposure to the central government for large exposure purposes?

The question explicitly refers to the second alternative (determination based on the CRM rules), namely the case where the application of Article 222(4) CRR is allowed. In accordance with this article, the 0% risk weight is permitted to be applied to the collateralized portion of the exposure arising from repurchase transaction and securities lending or borrowing transactions which fulfil the criteria in Article 227 CRR.  In this case, the reporting method according to COREP CRSA templates (template C 07.00 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 (ITS on Supervisory Reporting)) is the following:   In columns 010 to 040, the relevant amounts are reported in the exposure class of the counterparty   in row 010 (total)  in rows 090 and 100 (pertaining to Securities Financing Transactions) and  in the row corresponding to the applicable risk weight of the counterparty,     i.e. without taking into account the CRM effects.   As a consequence of credit risk mitigation techniques with substitution effects – in this case linked to a financial collateral simple method in accordance with Article 222 of CRR –, exposures collateralized should be reallocated to the exposure class of the issuer of the collateral. In case of cash collateral, the exposure class ‘other items’ is applied.

As a consequence of this is the obligations laid down in Parts Two to Four and Part Seven of the CRR would apply on a group-wide basis but also, where the subsidiaries of the group are also parent institutions in a Member State, at a sub-consolidated, national basis. However, if a group has at its top a parent financial holding company there may apply a different treatment. According to Article 11(2) sentence 1 CRR, institutions controlled by a parent financial holding company or a parent mixed financial holding company in a Member State shall comply, to the extent and in the manner prescribed in Article 18, with the obligations laid down in Parts Two to Four and Part Seven of the CRR on the basis of the consolidated situation of that financial holding company or mixed financial holding company. In multi-national financial holding groups the first sub-paragraph of Article 11(2) CRR might apply more than once, as well, but Article 11(2) sentence 2 CRR limits its application. According to the second sub-paragraph of Article 11(2) CRR where more than one institution is controlled by a parent financial holding company or by a parent mixed financial holding company in a Member State, the first subparagraph of Article 11(2) CRR shall apply only to the institution to which supervision on a consolidated basis applies in accordance with Article 111 CRD IV. According to second sub-paragraph of Article 111(3) CRD IV where the parent undertakings of institutions authorised in two or more Member States comprise more than one financial holding company or mixed financial holding company with head offices in different Member States and there is a credit institution in each of those States, supervision on a consolidated basis shall be exercised by the competent authority of the credit institution with the largest balance sheet total. As a consequence, one interpretation of the application of the obligations laid down in Parts Two to Four and Part Seven of the CRR could be only required on a group-wide, consolidated basis, as opposed to the treatment of banking groups described before according to the first sub-paragraph of Article 11(2) CRR . The reason for this is that the scope of Article 11(2) CRR is limited to the institution with the largest balance sheet total within a corporate structure, even when sentence 1 of this article is met more than once, whereas the scope of Article 11(1) CRR is not limited in this way. A difference in treatment concerning the sub-consolidated scope of application between a) groups which have a parent institution at its top and b) groups which have a parent financial holding company at its top may foster complex corporate structures as it may be an incentive for multi-national banking groups to introduce a parent financial holding company in order to avoid sub-consolidation in accordance with Article 11(1) CRR.

The above means that CCP, while calculating the EBRMi shall add exposure value of the CCP to clearing member i arising from all the contracts and transactions with that clearing member, calculated without taking into account the collateral posted by that clearing member; However, according to Article 50b(a)(ii), establishing the general rules for calculation of the hypothetical capital: for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(b), (c) and (e) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 shall calculate them in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 223 of that Regulation with supervisory volatility adjustments, specified in Articles 223 and 224 of that Regulation.

In consequence, a CCP, while calculating exposure value for all types of contracts mentioned in new Article 50b(a)(ii) of EMIR, has to calculate it using Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 223. This Method implies that the collateral value shall be deducted from the exposure value, taking into account both volatility and the risk-mitigating effects of collateral. Moreover, according to Article 50b(c) of EMIR, when calculating the value of the exposures, the CCP shall subtract from its exposures the collateral posted by its clearing members, appropriately reduced by the supervisory volatility adjustments in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 224 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.

The discontinuation of the non-performing status of a forborne exposure is governed by the provisions of paragraph 157, as specified by Q\u0026A 2014_735. It follows from this paragraph that the non-performing classification of a forborne exposure cannot be discontinued when the exposure is classified as impaired or defaulted, or where there is any past-due amount or concern regarding the full repayment of the exposure according to the post-forbearance conditions.  In case forbearance measures do not result in an improvement in the situation of the debtor but in a court procedure, leading to a compulsory settlement, bankruptcy or foreclosure, the exposure to which forbearance measures is related should remain classified as non-performing forborne exposure and reported as such in FINREP. Indeed, the court procedure can be considered as a default event in application of Article 178(3)(e) and (f) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 (CRR), and even if it were not identified as a default event, it evidences a concern regarding the full repayment of the exposure according to the post-forbearance conditions.","Article":"99","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":"In the bank we have a question on forbearance exit rules.

Therefore the treatment for instruments such as weather derivatives, contracts linked to (macro)economic key figures (e.g. inflation-linked bonds or derivatives on an inflation or unemployment rate), derivatives on freight rates, insurance risk (e.g. Cat Bonds, derivatives on life insurance products or operational risks), emission certificates etc. should be clarified. The second consultative document “Fundamental review of the trading book – A revised market risk framework” of the BCBS contains two paragraphs dealing with those products in future regulation. 1. Unusual underlyings, such as temperature in the case of weather derivatives, or mortality in the case of mortality bonds, will be assigned to an “other” bucket in the commodities asset class.

Standardised approach  In the case of the standardised approach to own funds requirements, inflation linked debt securities should be assimilated to floating rate debt instruments. These are debt instruments whose coupon is set periodically according to a relevant index, which in this case is an inflation index (such as CPI), instead of a market index (such as the EURIBOR) that a floating rate bond would follow, but its functioning is analogous. These instruments are subject to at least position risk, and therefore own funds requirements should be calculated according to Title IV, Chapter 2, Section 2 of the CRR. In particular, regarding the estimation of general risk within the standardised approach in Article 339 and 340, the calculation of own fund requirements should follow the specificities established for floating rate instruments.  Regarding derivative positions on certain \"unusual\" underlyings, it must be noted that some of the aforementioned underlyings can be considered as or assimilated to commodities, such as freight rate, weather derivatives or emission certificates. Following Article 358 of the CRR, derivatives on commodities are subject to commodities risk and its capital requirements have to be calculated according to Title 4, Chapter 4 of the CRR. Among other things, the requirements will depend on the kind of derivative concerned and on the notional value of the underlying. Therefore, in order to calculate these capital requirements, a notional value of the underlying is needed. This can be relatively straightforward for some of these instruments, for example, freight rates or emission certificates, for which a market value or at least a proxy for a market value can be easily found. For other derivatives, such as weather derivatives, for which there is no clear market price of the underlying, various approaches could be followed. The first choice would be to infer a quasi-market price from a pricing model, e.g. by constructing a product with similar pay-off features with an underlying for which an actual (spot or forward) price exists. Where this is not practical, other proxies might be used, such as an upper bound for the pay-off under the instrument which could be used as the \"market value\".  Internal models approach  When internal models are used to calculate own funds requirements, inflation-linked debt securities should be treated as debt instruments, for which a specific permission to use internal models must be granted, according to Article 363 of the CRR. Own funds requirements in this case would have to be calculated according to Title IV, Chapter 5 of the CRR, based on VaR and stressed VaR calculations, plus an Incremental Risk Capital charge when appropriate, taking into account the specificities applicable to debt instruments modelling established by the regulation.  As discussed before, in the case of derivative positions on certain \"unusual\" underlyings, they can be assimilated to commodities and, therefore, these commodities would fall under the category of \"commodity risk\" in Article 363 of the CRR, for which permission to apply internal risk models can be granted. Accordingly, capital requirements would have to be calculated according to Title IV, Chapter 5 of the CRR, based on VaR and stressed VaR calculations, taking into account the specificities applicable to commodities modelling.  DISCLAIMER:  This question goes beyond matters of consistent and effective application of the regulatory framework. A Directorate General of the Commission (Directorate General for Internal Market and Services) has prepared the answer, albeit that only the Court of Justice of the European Union can provide definitive interpretations of EU legislation.

The specific case submitted relates to a loan in the banking book for a which a write-off has been recorded. Annex V, Part 2 paragraphs 49 and 50 of Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 (ITS on Supervisory Reporting) clarifies that write-offs are the amount of principal and past due interest of any debt instrument that an institution is no longer recognising because they are considered uncollectible, and that they can be caused both by reductions of the carrying amount of financial assets recognised directly in profit or loss as well as by reductions in the amounts of the allowance accounts for credit losses taken against the carrying amount of financial assets.  Such a partial write-off does not constitute impairment, irrespective of the method (specific loan loss provision or direct reduction of the carrying amount) chosen to book impairment in the financial statements of the asset because any amounts written-back following a derecognition will not impact the carrying amount of the financial asset (unlike a reversal of impairment losses).   For the reason set out in the two paragraphs above, a partial write-off would not be included in the calculation of general and specific credit risk adjustments.

However, the scope and dependence on the respective accounting framework are not clear from the text of the CRR and requires interpretations. CRR per Article 24(1) basically acknowledges, that the valuation of all assets will be based on the applicable accounting framework. CRR Article 24(1) stipulates: \"The valuation of assets and off-balance sheet items shall be effected in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.\" Given that according to (German) local GAAP derivatives in the banking book must not be marked-to-market and hence do not generate P\u0026L nor CVA-P\u0026L, for the purposes of the CRR the value of banking book derivatives then is zero. In Article 381 the CRR again defines Credit Valuation Adjustment as an adjustment to the mid-market valuation accounting for the current market value of credit risk. In doing so the CRR acknowledges that CVA is a market value and therefore subject to the provision of CRR Article 24(1). CRR Article 381 (Meaning of Credit Valuation Adjustment) stipulates: \"For the purposes of this Title and Chapter 6 of Title II, 'Credit Valuation Adjustmen' or 'CVA' means an adjustment to the mid-market valuation of the portfolio of transactions with a counterparty.\" That adjustment reflects the current market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the institution, but does not reflect the current market value of the credit risk of the institution to the counterparty. Under German local GAAP institutions do not account a market value of credit risk for their banking book derivatives positions. Therefore, the valuation of institutions’ banking book derivatives positions under local GAAP are not subject to fluctuations of market factors such as interest rates or credit spreads, i.e. there is no fluctuation in the valuation of these positions and hence no \"risk\". The CRR proceeds in Article 382(1) to define the scope of the application of the CVA risk requirements, referring to \"all OTC derivatives instruments\" (a specification on the type of the derivative, i.e. \"OTC\") and \"all business activities\" (a specification on the matrix of customers and markets). CRR Article 382 (1) (Scope) stipulates: \"An institution shall calculate the own funds requirements for CVA risk in accordance with this Title for all OTC derivative instruments in respect of all of its business activities, other than credit derivatives recognised to reduce risk-weighted exposure amounts for credit risk.\" Note how the CRR does not re-define or even invalidate the requirements stipulated in Article 24 (1) with respect to the accounting framework. However, the wording in Article 382 (1) has puzzled some market participants as to the precise interpretation and coherence of the aforementioned articles of the CRR. The question that arises is: Must institutions that use local GAAP for Accounting purposes calculate a CVA Risk Charge for derivatives in the banking book?

Im derzeitigen Stadium kann im Rahmen des Frage- und Antwortverfahrens nicht bestätigt werden, ob deutsche Vorzugsaktien aufgrund der vorgelegten Informationen als hartes Kernkapital akzeptiert werden. Gemäß Artikel 26 Absatz 3 CRR bewerten die zuständigen Behörden, ob die Emission von Instrumenten des harten Kernkapitals den Kriterien des Artikels 28 oder gegebenenfalls des Artikels 29 genügt. Nach dem 28. Juni 2013 begebene Kapitalinstrumente werden nur dann als Instrumente des harten Kernkapitals eingestuft, wenn die zuständigen Behörden, gegebenenfalls nach Konsultation der EBA, zuvor die Erlaubnis gegeben haben.    Auf der Grundlage der Angaben jeder zuständigen Behörde erstellt, führt und veröffentlicht die EBA ein Verzeichnis sämtlicher Arten von Kapitalinstrumenten in jedem Mitgliedstaat, die als hartes Kernkapital akzeptiert werden.     Da sich die Frage speziell auf Vorzugsausschüttungen bezieht, dürfte die endgültige Antwort von dem technischen Regulierungsstandard abhängen, den die EBA zur Bedeutung des Begriffs Vorzugsausschüttung (gemäß Artikel 28 Absatz 5) vorlegen soll.  Wenn die deutschen Vorzugsaktien als hartes Kernkapital anerkannt werden, dann wird auch das damit verbundene Agio gemäß Artikel 26 Absatz 1 Buchstabe c als hartes Kernkapital akzeptiert.     Falls deutsche Vorzugsaktien nicht zum harten Kernkapital zählen, könnten sie jedoch als Instrumente des zusätzlichen Kernkapitals anerkannt werden, falls die in Artikel 52 Absatz 1 genannten Bedingungen erfüllt werden. In diesem Fall würde auch das damit verbundene Agio gemäß Artikel 51 Buchstabe b als zusätzliches Kernkapital anerkannt.  Das Agio in Verbindung mit den vor dem 31. Dezember 2010 begebenen Instrumenten zählt zu den Posten des harten Kernkapitals, wenn die in Artikel 485 genannten Bedingungen erfüllt werden, d. h. wenn das Agio mit Kapital im Sinne des Artikels 22 der Richtlinie 86/635/EG verbunden ist und die Instrumente im Rahmen von nationalen Umsetzungsmaßnahmen gemäß Artikel 57 Buchstabe a der Richtlinie 2006/48/EG zu den Basiseigenmitteln zählen.   Gemäß dem deutschen Kreditwesengesetz werden Vorzugsaktien derzeit nur  als Ergänzungskapital anerkannt. Daher erfüllt das damit verbundene Agio die in Artikel 485 genannten Bedingungen nicht und kann daher auch nicht als hartes Kernkapital  eingestuft werden.     Translation to EN:  Regulation (EU) 575/2013 (CRR) distinguishes between Common Equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 within Tier 1 capital.   It is not possible to confirm at this stage and as part of the Q\u0026A process whether German preference shares qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 on the basis of the information supplied. In accordance with Article 26 (3) of CRR competent authorities shall evaluate whether issuances of Common Equity Tier 1 instruments meet the criteria set out in Article 28 or where applicable Article 29. With respect to issuances after 28 June 2013, institutions shall classify capital instruments as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments only after permission is granted by the competent authorities, which may consult EBA.   On the basis of the information from each competent authority, the EBA will establish, maintain and publish a list of all the forms of capital instruments in each Member State that qualify as Common Equity Tier 1.  More specifically, as the question relates to preferential distributions, the final answer may depend on the Regulatory Technical Standard the EBA is mandated to submit on the meaning of preferential distributions (as per Article 28 (5)).  If the German preference shares qualify as CET1, then the related share premium accounts will also qualify as CET1 pursuant Article 26(1) (c).   If German preference shares do not qualify as Common Equity Tier 1, they could however qualify as Additional Tier 1 instruments if the conditions laid down in Article 52(1) are met. In that case, the related share premium accounts would also qualify as Additional Tier 1 pursuant Article 51(b).      Share premium accounts related to instruments issued prior to 31 December 2010 shall qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 Items if the conditions laid down in Article 485 are met i.e. the share premium accounts are related to capital within the meaning of Art. 22 of Directive 86/635/EC and the instruments qualify as original own funds under national transposition measures for point (a) of Article 57 of Directive 2006/48/EC.   Under the German Banking Act, preference shares currently only qualify as Tier 2 capital. Therefore the related share premium accounts do not meet the conditions laid down in Article 485 and cannot be classified as CET1.   ","Article":"28","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":"Kapitalinstrumente dürfen gem. Art. 28 Abs. 1 Buchstabe h Ziffer i CRR keine Vorzugsbehandlung erfahren. In Ziffer vi wird bestimmt, dass keine Ausschüttungspflicht bestehen darf. Deutsche Vorzugsaktien genügen diesen Anforderungen bislang nicht, da sie einen nachzuzahlenden Vorzug beinhalten. Deswegen sind sie bislang als Ergänzungskapital nach KWG anerkannt. Die Kapitalrücklage \"zugehörig zu\" den Vorzugsaktien gilt bislang als Kernkapital. Gem. Artikel 26 Abs. 1 Buchstabe b soll nur das mit dem Kapitalinstrument verbundene Agio als Kernkapital gelten, d.h. die Kapitalrücklage die mit dem Ergänzungskapital \"verbunden\" ist, gehört gem. Art. 62 Buchstabe b mit Inkrafttreten der CRR zum 01.01.2014 zum Ergänzungskapital. Am 28. Juni 2013 hat der Deutsche Bundestag die Aktienrechtsnovelle beschlossen. Der Sechste Unterabschnitt des Aktiengesetzes (Vorzugsaktien ohne Stimmrecht) wird in § 139 dahingehend geändert, dass das Wort \"nachzuzahlenden\" gestrichen wird, somit also nur noch von \"Aktien, die mit einem Vorzug bei der Verteilung des Gewinns ausgestattet sind\" die Rede ist. Weiterhin muss die Satzung dahingehend geändert werden, dass der Vorzug nicht nachgezahlt wird. Damit dürften deutsche Vorzugsaktien grundsätzlich kernkapitalfähig sein. Die Reihenfolge der Ausschüttungen wird in Art. 28 Abs. 1 Buchstabe h Ziffer i der CRR ebenfalls ausgeschlossen. Dort steht: \"es gibt keine Vorzugsbehandlung in Bezug auf die Reihenfolge der Ausschüttungen, auch nicht im Zusammenhang mit anderen Instrumenten des harten Kernkapitals, und in den für das Instrument geltenden Bestimmungen sind keine Vorzugsrechte für die Auszahlung von Ausschüttungen vorgesehen\". Weiterhin steht in § 28 Abs. 4 CRR: Für die Zwecke des Absatzes 1 Buchstabe h Ziffer i dürfen Unterschiede bei der Ausschüttung nur Ausdruck von Unterschieden bei den Stimmrechten sein. Hierbei darf eine höhere Ausschüttung nur für Instrumenten des harten Kernkapitals vorgenommen werden, an die weniger oder keine Stimmrechte geknüpft sind.\" Zu der Bedeutung des Begriffs „Vozugsausschüttung“ gem. Art. 28 Abs. 5 Buchstabe c CRR soll die EBA einen technischen Regulierungsstandard erarbeiten. Im RTS 2013/01 (Own funds) habe ich diesbezüglich keine Besonderheiten gefunden. Sind deutsche Vorzugsaktien nach der Aktienrechtsnovelle kernkapitalfähig, so dass auch das Agio, das mit dem Instrument \"verbunden\" ist, im Kernkapital anerkannt werden kann? Translation to EN: Under Article 28(1)(h)(i) of CRR, there must be no preferential distribution treatment regarding the order of distribution payments in respect of Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. Item h(vi) specifies that there must be no obligation to pay distributions. German preference shares do not yet meet these requirements, because they entail a cumulative preferential distribution. For this reason they have hitherto been recognised as supplementary capital under the Banking Act (Kreditwesensgesetz). The capital surplus comprising German preference shares has always counted as Tier 1 equity. Under Article 26(1)(b) of CRR, only the share premium accounts related to the capital instrument are to be regarded as a Common Equity Tier 1 item, which means that, under Article 62(b), capital surplus ‘related to’ supplementary capital will be a Tier 2 item when the CRR enters into force on 1 January 2014. On 28.06.13, the Bundestag adopted a revision of company law. The sixth subsection of the Companies Act (Aktiengesetz), headed ‘Non-voting preference shares’, was amended in Section 139, the word ‘cumulative’ being deleted, leaving only a reference to ‘shares that carry the benefit of a preference right with regard to the distribution of profits’. In addition, the company’s instruments of incorporation must be amended to the effect that preferential distributions are not payable on a cumulative basis. This ought to ensure that German preference shares qualify, in principle, as Tier 1 capital. An order of distribution is also ruled out by Article 28(1)(h)(i) of CRR, which states that ‘there is no preferential distribution treatment regarding the order of distribution payments, including in relation to other Common Equity Tier 1 instruments, and the terms governing the instruments do not provide preferential rights to payment of distributions’. Moreover, Article 28(4) of CRR states that ‘For the purposes of point (h)(i) of paragraph 1, differentiated distributions shall only reflect differentiated voting rights. In this respect, higher distributions shall only apply to Common Equity Tier 1 instruments with fewer or no voting rights.’ Article 28(5)(c) of CRR states that the EBA should develop a draft regulatory technical standard to specify the meaning of preferential distributions. In RTS 2013/01, on institutions’ own funds, I have not found any particularly relevant provisions. Do German preference shares qualify as Tier 1 capital under the amended Companies Act, which would mean that share premium accounts ‘linked to’ the instrument may be recognised as part of Tier 1 capital?"}

Yet, according to Art. 352 (4) CRR positions in the reporting currency do not count to the institution 19s overall net foreign-exchange position. Against this background, it is not clear whether the matched part of a position in a currency that is closely correlated to the institution 19s reporting currency may be treated according to Art. 354 CRR, thereby attracting a privileged own funds charge, as this might be seen as an implicit inclusion of a position in the institution 19s reporting currency in the foreign exchange position. Assume that EUR is the reporting currency of an institution and, furthermore, that this institution has matched positions (i.e. positions of opposite sign) in two closely correlated currencies which are both foreign currencies for the institution (e.g. long position in USD and short position in GBP). If both currencies appreciate (which they will do simultaneously in most cases as they are closely correlated), the institution will tend to gain on the long (USD) position at the same time when it loses on the short (GBP) position. Those gains and losses will tend to compensate each other (albeit not completely), so that the potential 1cnet economic loss 1d is limited both in absolute and relative terms. This justifies a lower own funds charge for such matched positions (4%, 1,6% or even 0% according to Art. 354 (1), (4) or (6) CRR). Alternatively, consider matched positions in the reporting currency (EUR, long) and a closely correlated foreign currency (GBP, short). If the foreign currency (GBP) appreciates, the resulting loss will not be offset by gains in the reporting currency (EUR). On the other hand, the potential loss is limited in absolute terms by the fact that both currencies are closely correlated, so that the volatility of the exchange rate will be low, thereby causing generally low losses (compared to a situation of two completely uncorrelated currencies, where the volatility of the exchange rate will be higher and where potentially large gains and losses have therefore to be anticipated).

A Directorate General of the Commission (Directorate General for Internal Market and Services) has prepared the answer, albeit that only the Court of Justice of the European Union can provide definitive interpretations of EU legislation. This is an unofficial opinion of that Directorate General, which the European Banking Authority publishes on its behalf. The answers are not binding on the European Commission as an institution. You should be aware that the European Commission could adopt a position different from the one expressed in such Q\u0026As, for instance in infringement proceedings or after a detailed examination of a specific case or on the basis of any new legal or factual elements that may have been brought to its attention.     Translation to ES:                      Las instituciones aplicarán el respectivo tratamiento previsto en los artículos 123, 154, 178, apartado 1, letra b), y 501 del Reglamento (EU) No 575/2013  a las exposiciones que satisfagan los criterios establecidos en tales disposiciones. En lo que atañe a los artículos 123 y 154, y, en su caso, la excepción recogida en la segunda frase del artículo 178, apartado 1, letra b), las instituciones, aparte de las exposiciones frente a personas físicas, incluirán a este efecto las exposiciones cualificadas en las que identifiquen que su contraparte es una PYME. En la Recomendación 2003/361/CE de 6 de mayo de 2003 se les ofrecen directrices al respecto. A efectos del artículo 501, y según se refiere con detalle en el apartado 2, letra b) del mismo, están obligadas a utilizar la definición recogida en dicha Recomendación.     EXENCIÓN DE RESPONSABILIDAD:            Esta cuestión trasciende a los asuntos relativos a la aplicación coherente y eficaz del marco regulador. Una Dirección General de la Comisión (la Dirección General de Mercado Interior y Servicios) ha preparado la respuesta, aún cuando únicamente el Tribunal de Justicia de la Unión Europea puede proporcionar interpretaciones definitivas de la legislación de la UE. La presente es un dictamen no oficial de dicha Dirección General, que la Autoridad Bancaria Europea publica en su nombre. Las respuestas no son vinculantes para la Comisión Europea como institución. Han de tener en cuenta que la Comisión Europea podría adoptar una posición diferente de la expresada en tales preguntas y respuestas; por ejemplo, en procedimientos de infracción, tras un examen pormenorizado de un asunto específico, o sobre la base de cualesquiera nuevos elementos de hecho o de derecho que puedan habérsele planteado.","Article":"123","Status":"Final Q\u0026A ","Question":"¿Qué criterios debe reunir una empresa para considerarse que es \"PyME\"?

This represents a consistent use of 'Not applicable' in Annexes I and II.  Regarding the abovementioned examples:  Ad example 1:   Template C 101.00 of Annex II includes the information on obligor level for the hypothetical portfolio in Low Default Portfolios. Therefore column 080 (Geographical Area) is always provided. 'Not applicable' is just a default value for column 080. In Template C 102.00 of Annex II 'Not applicable' has the meaning that all information has to be provided regardless of the country of residence.  Ad example 2:   Again 'Not applicable' has the meaning that all information ignoring 'Indexed Loan to value range' has to be provided in this cluster. These clusters are therefore a higher aggregation of clusters where a breakdown by 'Indexed Loan to value range' is required due to including all LTV ranges.  Ad example 3:   'Not applicable' in column 120, Template C 103.00 of Annex II, must be read in conjunction with the column 080, Template C 103.00 of Annex II. In particular:   for the segmentation value 'Exposure with credit protection' in column 080 'Not applicable' in column 120 means all the exposures secured by any credit protection;  for the segmentation value 'Exposure without credit protection' in column 080 'Not applicable' in column 120 means all the unsecured exposures;  for the segmentation value 'Not applicable' in column 080 'Not applicable' in column 120 means all the secured and unsecured exposures.      'Not applicable' in Annexes III and IV   Value 'Not applicable' is just used in two fields in Annexes III and IV, namely columns 030 'Regulatory approach' and 020 'Exposure class'. The meaning of 'Not applicable' is given in a footnote of Annex IV: ''Not applicable' shall be used when none of the answers in the list is correct (e.g. for column 020, it will mean that the counterparty is classified in multiple asset classes, without one being clearly pre-dominant).'

From this it could be inferred that not only the swingline portion - i.e. loans to other entities to cover possible shortfalls from other debt commitments - of a facility would have a place in the liquidity facilities. Therefore the amount of the commitment to be treated as a liquidity facility for the purposes of Part Six of CRR is the overall amount of the currently outstanding funding issued by the client (or proportionate share, if a syndicated facility) maturing within a 30 day period that is backstopped by the facility.

Consequently, no evidence is needed whether or not the client is unable to obtain funding in financial markets or whether a particular refinancing instrument fails, as this is the underlying assumption in the LCR.

It also applies to financial sector entities that are subject to prudential supervisory and regulatory requirements which are not deemed to be at least equivalent to those applied in the Union.  This follows from the following considerations:  The definition of a 'large financial sector entity' in Article 142(1)(4) of the CRR only applies to financial sector entities as defined in Article 4(1)(27), provided that both the 'prudential regulation condition' in Article 142(1)(4)(b) and the 'size condition' in Article 142(4)(a) are met. In other words, this definition is only applicable to large 'prudentially regulated' financial sector entities and those which are not directly 'prudentially regulated' but with at least one 'prudentially regulated' subsidiary.  By contrast, the definition of an 'unregulated financial sector entity' in Article 142(1)(5) of the CRR is applicable to any entities which are neither directly 'prudentially regulated' nor have at least one 'prudentially regulated' subsidiary, provided that they perform, as their main business, one or more of the activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2013/36/EU or in Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC.  Consequently, the requirement in Article 153(2) of the CRR to multiply the coefficient of correlation by 1.25 applies only to exposures to 'prudentially regulated' financial sector entities which meet the 'size condition' in Article 142(1)(4)(a) of the CRR, and to all entities which meet both of the following conditions:  a)            they perform, as their main business, one or more of the activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2013/36/EU, or in Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC; and  b)            they do not meet the 'prudential regulation condition' of Article 142(1)(4)(b) of the CRR.  It is worth noting that the 'prudential regulation condition' in Article 142(1)(4)(b) of the CRR is not limited to the CRR and the national transposition of Directive 2013/36/EU.  As an illustration, this condition can also be met where, in a Member State, financial institutions (to which the CRR is not applicable) are subject to prudential and supervisory requirements equivalent to those applied to institutions.

However point 161 of Annex V states that: “Accumulated impairment reported on non-performing exposures shall not include incurred but not reported losses. Incurred but not reported losses shall be reported in accumulated impairment on performing exposures.”  The instructions can be interpreted in two ways:   Collective allowances for IBNR losses on non-performing exposures can’t be reported in template F 18.00, therefore F 18.00 doesn’t contain all allowances. Only IBNR losses on performing exposures shall be reported in the column “performing” (c140 of F 18.00). Some reporting institutions fill in template F 18.00, F 19.00 according to this interpretation.  Collective allowances for IBNR losses on non-performing exposures shall be reported in column “performing”, while the exposure amount stays in the “non-performing” column. However in this case data on gross carrying amounts of performing/non-performing exposures are not consistent with data on impairment on performing/non-performing exposures.

The assessment of the financial difficulties of the debtor should be based on the situation of the debtor only, disregarding collateral or any guarantees provided by third parties, as the focus of the definition is the financial difficulties of a particular debtor and its (in)ability to meet its financial obligations.

Paragraph 165 provides some evidence of what a concession includes, but other situations are possible (for instance when a debtor is in financial difficulties, an exposure modified at market rate will be considered as forborne).  Each institution is responsible for using its own judgement when identifying situations of financial difficulties, subject to the provisions of paragraph 172, laying down situations that always qualify as forbearance, i.e. situations where the debtor should always be considered in financial difficulties and where any modification or refinancing is therefore a concession.

For each individual grade or pool, the PD assigned to the specific grade or pool shall be reported.

If the reporting institution applies a unique rating system or is able to report according to an internal scale, this scale is used.

This is supported by the following: • Response provided in the EBA FAQ-on-ITS-on-reporting issuance dated 15 March 2013 where a definition of obligor was provided (please see below). Please see instructions to column 300 - The number of obligors shall be calculated based on groups of connected clients according to art. 4 (46) CRR. • Column 300 provides additional support to this interpretation in stating; As this column deals with an element of the structure of the rating system, it relates to the original exposures pre conversion factor assigned to each obligor grade or pool without taking into account the effect of the CRM technique (in particular redistribution effects). • Column 010 is before column 020 Original exposure pre conversion factors, and not grouped with elements of the RWA calculation (after the exposure value) such as the weighted average LGD % in column 230 and 240. Instructions for column 020 state institutions report the exposure value before taking into account value adjustments provisions, effects due to credit risk mitigation techniques or credit conversion factors. • Unlike the weighted average LGD % (which clearly states this value is after all CRM impacts and applicable floors), the Internal rating system / PD assigned to the obligor grade or pool % makes no mention of CRM effects or floors either explicitly or by reference to a CRR Article. • Column 070/080 Total inflows and outflows is where the effects of PD substitution (credit risk mitigation) would be reflected on the exposure and where relevant the PD. • Within our internal rating system approved by our competent authority our obligors can receive a rating below the floor.
